 Executive  Officer,  acquired a single  retail  florist in New York City,\\nwhich he  subsequently  expanded to a 14-store  chain Thereafter,  the Company\\nmodified  its  business  strategy to take  advantage  of the rapid  emergence of\\ntoll-free callingThe Company acquired the right to use the toll-free telephone\\nnumber  1-800-FLOWERS,  adopted  it as  its  corporate  identity  and  began  to\\naggressively  build a national brand around itThe Company  believes it was one\\nof the first companies to embrace this new way of conducting business.\\nTo support the growth of its toll-free business and to provide superior customer\\nservice, the Company developed an operating infrastructure that incorporated the\\nbest available technologies Over time, the Company implemented a sophisticated\\n                                       1\\ntransaction   processing   system  that   facilitated   rapid  order  entry  and\\nfulfillment, an advanced telecommunications system and multiple customer service\\ncenters to handle increasing call volume.\\nTo enable the Company to deliver products  reliably  nationwide on a same-day or\\nnext-day basis and to market  pre-selected,  high-quality  floral products,  the\\nCompany created  BloomNet(R),  a nationwide network including  independent local\\nflorists selected for their high-quality products, superior customer service and\\norder fulfillment and delivery capabilities.\\nIn the early 1990s,  the Company  recognized  the emergence of the Internet as a\\nsignificant  strategic  opportunity  and moved  aggressively to embrace this new\\nmedium By taking advantage of investments in its  infrastructure,  the Company\\nwas able to quickly develop and implement an online presence As a result,  the\\nCompany  was one of the  first  companies  to  market  products  online  through\\nCompuServe  beginning in 1992 and AOL beginning in 1994 (keyword:  flowers) In\\nApril  1995,  the  Company  opened  its fully

development  of a hybrid  fulfillment  system  which\\nenables the Company to offer same-day,  next-day and any-day delivery,  combines\\nthe use of BloomNet(R)  (independent  florists operating retail flower shops and\\nLFC\\'s, Company-owned stores and fulfillment centers, and franchise stores), with\\nthe Company-owned  distribution centers and brand-name vendors who ship directly\\nto the Company\\'s customers While providing a significant competitive advantage\\nin terms of delivery  options,  the  Company\\'s  fulfillment  system also has the\\nadded benefit of reducing the  Company\\'s  capital  investments  in inventory and\\ninfrastructureFulfillment of products is as follows:\\nFlowers A  majority  of the  Company\\'s  floral  orders are  fulfilled  through\\nBloomNet(R) The Company selects retail florists for BloomNet(R) based upon the\\nhistorical  volume of floral  deliveries in a particular  geographic  area,  the\\nnumber of  BloomNet(R)  florists  currently  serving the area and the  florist\\'s\\ndesign staff, facilities,  quality of floral processing,  and ability to fulfill\\norders in sufficient  volume and delivery  capabilities The Company  regularly\\nmonitors  BloomNet(R)  florists\\'  performance  and  adherence  to the  Company\\'s\\nquality standards to ensure proper fulfillment.\\nBy fulfilling floral orders through BloomNet(R),  the Company is able to deliver\\nfloral products on a same-day, next-day or any day basis to ensure freshness and\\nto meet the customers\\'  need for prompt  delivery Because the Company  selects\\nthese florists and receives customer feedback on their performance in fulfilling\\norders,  it is able to ensure  consistent  product quality and  presentation and\\noffer a greater variety of  arrangements,  which the Company  believes creates a\\nbetter experience for its customers and gift recipients.\\nThe Company\\'s relationships with its BloomNet(R) members are non-exclusiveMany\\nflorists,  including many BloomNet(R) florists, also are members of other floral\\nfulfillment  organizations The BloomNet(R) agreements generally are cancelable\\nby either  party with ten days  notification  and do not  guarantee  any orders,\\ndollar amounts or exclusive  territories from the Company to the florist As of\\nJuly 3, 2005, the Company had entered into  approximately  59 Order  Fulfillment\\nAgreements  with  selected  BloomNet(R)  members  to  operate  LFC\\'s,  providing\\ncoverage  of all  significant  population  centers  across  the  United  States.\\nGenerally,  these agreements  provide for a three-year term,  terminable upon 30\\ndays notice upon breach and  immediately  by the Company in the event of certain\\nspecified  defaults  by  the  operator  of  the  LFC In  consideration  of the\\noperator\\'s  satisfactory  performance,  the  Company  agrees  to use  reasonable\\nefforts to forward orders with a specified minimum merchandise value during each\\nyear of the agreementThe Company has not granted an exclusive territory to any\\nIn  certain  instances,  the  Company is  required  to  fulfill  orders  through\\nnon-BloomNet(R)  members,  and transmits these orders to the fulfilling  florist\\nusing the communication  system of an independent wire service or via telephone.\\nAdditionally,  the  Company  offers  its  customers  an  alternative  to florist\\ndesigned products through its \"Fresh From Our Growers\" programIn this program,\\nthe Company ships overnight via common carrier to its

believes it has an advanced  technology  platform Its  technology\\ninfrastructure,  primarily  consisting of the  Company\\'s Web sites,  transaction\\nprocessing,  customer  databases and  telecommunications  systems,  is built and\\nmaintained for reliability,  security,  scalability and flexibilityTo minimize\\nthe   risk   of   service    interruptions   from   unexpected    component   or\\ntelecommunications failure, maintenance and upgrades, the Company has built full\\nback-up and system  redundancies  into those components of its systems that have\\nbeen  identified  as  critical  In  recent  years  the  Company  installed  an\\nOracle-based  order  processing  and  database   management  system;   developed\\nBloomLink(R),  upgraded  its  telecommunications

and\\nexpand its e-commerce and telecommunication capabilities.\\nThe  Company\\'s  transaction  processing  system  captures  customer  profile and\\nhistory in a customized  Oracle  database  and selects the florist,  third-party\\nvendor,  or  Company-owned  warehouse  to fulfill the order Through the use of\\ncustomized  software  applications,  the Company is able to  retrieve,  sort and\\nanalyze  customer  information  to enable it to better serve its  customers  and\\ntarget its product offerings.\\nThe Company\\'s customer service centers and third-party outsourcers are connected\\nelectronically  to  its  transaction  processing  system  to  permit  the  rapid\\ntransmission  of, and access to,  critical  order and customer  information In\\naddition,  BloomLink(R)  electronically  connects the Company to its BloomNet(R)\\nmembers and non-floral vendors.\\nThe Company\\'s operations center is located in its headquarters in Westbury,  New\\nYorkThe Company provides comprehensive facility management services, including\\nhuman and technical  monitoring  of all  production  servers,  24 hours per day,\\nseven days per week.\\nThe Company\\'s quarterly results may experience seasonal fluctuationsDue to the\\nCompany\\'s expansion into non-floral products,  including the acquisitions of The\\nWinetasting  Network  and Cheryl & Co during  fiscal  2005,  the  Thanksgiving\\nthrough Christmas holiday season, which falls within the Company\\'s second fiscal\\nquarter,  generates the highest  proportion of the  Company\\'s  annual  revenues.\\nAdditionally,  as the  result of a number  of major  floral  gifting  occasions,\\nincluding Mother\\'s Day,  Administrative  Professionals Week and Easter, revenues\\nalso rise during the  Company\\'s  fiscal  fourth  quarter In addition,  results\\nduring the Company\\'s  fiscal first  quarter will be  negatively  impacted by the\\naforementioned  acquisitions  due to their seasonal  nature and the  incremental\\noverhead incurred during this slow period.\\n                                       10\\nThe growing  popularity and convenience of e-commerce has continued to give rise\\nto established businesses on the InternetIn addition to selling their products\\nover the  Internet,  many of these  retailers  sell  their  products  through  a\\ncombination of channels by maintaining a Web site, a toll-free  phone number and\\nphysical locations Additionally, several of these merchants offer an expanding\\nvariety of products and some are  attracting an increasing  number of customers.\\nCertain mass  merchants  have  expanded  their  offerings  to include  competing\\nproducts and may continue to do so in the futureThese mass merchants,  as well\\nas other potential competitors, may be able to:\\n      o undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and\\n      o adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and\\n      o make more attractive offers to potential employees, distributors and\\nIn addition,  the Company faces intense  competition  in each of its  individual\\nproduct  categories In the floral  industry,  there are various

In\\naddition,  many of the non-floral  products sold by the Company are manufactured\\nand delivered to its customers by independent  third-party vendorsIf customers\\nare dissatisfied  with the performance of the local florist or other third-party\\nvendors,  they may not utilize the Company\\'s services when placing future orders\\nand its revenues may decrease.\\nIf a florist  discontinues  its  relationship  with the Company,  the  Company\\'s\\ncustomers  may  experience  delays in service or declines in quality and may not\\nshop with the  Company  again Many of the  Company\\'s  arrangements  with local\\nflorists for order  fulfillment  may be  terminated  with 10 days  notice If a\\nflorist  discontinues  its  relationship  with the Company,  the Company will be\\nrequired to obtain a suitable  replacement  located in the same geographic area,\\nwhich may cause delays in delivery or a decline in quality,  leading to customer\\ndissatisfaction and loss of customers.\\nIf a significant amount of customers are not satisfied with their purchase,  the\\nCompany will be required to incur substantial costs to issue refunds, credits or\\nreplacement  products The Company  offers its  customers  a 100%  satisfaction\\nguarantee on its productsIf customers are not satisfied with the products they\\nreceive,  the Company will either  replace the product for the customer or issue\\nthe customer a refund or credit The Company\\'s  net income would  decrease if a\\nsignificant number of customers request replacement products, refunds or credits\\nand the Company is unable to pass such costs onto the supplier.\\nIncreased  shipping costs and labor stoppages may adversely  affect sales of the\\nCompany\\'s  products Many of the Company\\'s  products are delivered to customers\\neither directly from the manufacturer or from the Company\\'s  fulfillment centers\\nlocated in California,  Illinois,  New York, Ohio and Virginia The Company has\\nestablished  relationships with Federal Express, United Parcel Service and other\\ncommon  carriers for the delivery of these  products If these carriers were to\\nincrease  the prices they charge to ship the  Company\\'s  goods,  and the Company\\npasses these  increases on to its customers,  its customers  might choose to buy\\ncomparable  products  locally to avoid  shipping  charges In  addition,  these\\ncarriers  may  experience  labor  stoppages,  which could  impact the  Company\\'s\\nability to deliver  products on a timely basis to our  customers  and  adversely\\naffect its customer relationships.\\nIf the Company fails to continuously improve its Web site, it may not attract or\\nretain customers If potential or existing  customers do not find the Company\\'s\\nWeb site a

of operations.\\nIf the Company does not accurately predict customer demand for its products,  it\\nmay lose customers or experience  increased  costsIn the past, the Company did\\nnot need to  maintain a  significant  inventory  of  products However,  as the\\nCompany expands the volume of non-floral products offered to its customers,  the\\nCompany will be required to increase inventory levels and the number of products\\nmaintained in its warehouses If the Company overestimates  customer demand for\\nits products, excess inventory and outdated merchandise could accumulate,  tying\\nup working capital and potentially  resulting in reduced warehouse  capacity and\\ninventory  losses  due  to  damage,  theft  and  obsolescence If  the  Company\\nunderestimates  customer demand, it may disappoint customers who may turn to its\\ncompetitors Moreover,  the strength of the  1-800-FLOWERS.COM  brands could be\\ndiminished due to misjudgments in merchandise selection.\\nIf the supply of flowers for sale becomes  limited,  the price of flowers  could\\nrise or flowers may be unavailable and the Company\\'s  revenues and gross margins\\ncould  decline A variety of factors affect the supply of flowers in the United\\nStates and the price of the Company\\'s floral products If the supply of flowers\\navailable for sale is limited due to weather conditions or other factors, prices\\nfor flowers could rise and customer demand for the Company\\'s floral products may\\nbe reduced,  causing revenues and gross margins to decline Alternatively,  the\\nCompany may not

garden gift category,  which implemented a revised marketing plan to enhance\\nits product  offerings,  and improve the creative  look and feel of its catalogs\\nafter experiencing a decline in sales during fiscal 2004In addition,  revenues\\nwere  favorably  impacted  by the  incremental  revenue  from  Cheryl  & Co.,  a\\nmanufacturer  of cookies and baked gifts,  which was acquired in March

sales channels experienced strong growth in the floral and\\ncomplementary gift categories of gourmet food gifts, such as the Popcorn Factory\\nline of  products,  gift  baskets  and  children\\'s  gifts,  but this  growth was\\npartially  offset by slower  sales in the home and  garden  gift  category  as a\\nresult of internal  marketing and merchandising  issues, as well as increasingly\\ncompetitive market conditions.\\nThe Company fulfilled approximately 10,213,000,  9,322,000, and 8,681,000 orders\\nthrough its  combined  telephonic  and online sales  channels  during

the  Company\\'s  online sales channel  increased  17.5% and\\n15.6%, during the years ended July 3, 2005 and June 27, 2004, respectively, as a\\nresult of  improved  conversion  of  qualified  traffic  through  the  Company\\'s\\nWebsites, and increased marketing efforts through search engines and affiliates.\\nThe continued migration of customers from the Company\\'s telephonic sales channel\\nalso contributed to the growth within the online sales channel, resulting in the\\norder volume  decreases of 1.1% and 1.9%  experienced  by the  telephonic  sales\\nchannel  during the

31\\ncontinue to drive revenue  growth  through its online sales channel and continue\\nthe  migration  of its  customers  from  the  telephone  to the Web for  several\\nimportant  reasons:  (i)  online  orders  are less  expensive  to  process  than\\ntelephonic  orders,  (ii) online  customers can view the Company\\'s full range of\\ngift offerings,  including  non-floral  gifts,  which in

Cheryl & Co.\\nAt the start of the second half of fiscal 2005, the Company initiated a strategy\\ndesigned  to  extend  the  Company\\'s  leadership  position  in  the  floral  and\\nthoughtful gift

U.S.\\ngenerally  accepted  accounting  principles The preparation of these financial\\nstatements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\\nreported  amount of assets,  liabilities,  revenue  and  expenses,  and  related\\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilitiesOn an ongoing basis, management\\nevaluates  its  estimates,  including  those  related  to  revenue  recognition,\\ninventory and long-lived assets,  including goodwill and other intangible assets\\nrelated  to  acquisitions Management  bases its  estimates  and  judgments  on\\nhistorical  experience  and on various  other  factors  that are  believed to be\\nreasonable  under the  circumstances,  the  results  of which form the basis for\\nmaking  judgments  about the carrying values of assets and  liabilities Actual\\nresults  may  differ  from  these  estimates  under  different   assumptions  or\\nconditions Management  believes the following  critical  accounting  policies,\\namong  others,  affect its more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used in\\npreparation of its consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet  revenues  are  generated  by  online,  telephonic  and  retail  fulfillment\\noperations and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise, service or\\noutbound shipping charges, less discounts, returns and creditsNet revenues are\\nrecognized upon product shipment.\\nAccounts Receivable\\nThe Company  maintains  allowances  for doubtful  accounts for estimated  losses\\nresulting  from the inability of its customers or  franchisees  to make required\\npayments If the financial  condition of the Company\\'s customers or franchisees\\nwere to  deteriorate,  resulting  in an  impairment  of  their  ability  to make\\npayments, additional allowances may be required.\\nThe Company  states  inventory at the lower of cost or market In assessing the\\nrealization  of  inventories,  we are  required to make  judgments  as to future\\ndemand  requirements and compare that with inventory levelsIt is possible that\\nchanges in consumer  demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable  value\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the\\nnet assets  acquired  and is  evaluated  annually  for  impairment The cost of\\n                                       39\\nintangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of\\neconomic benefits consumed, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated periods\\nbenefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years.\\nThe Company periodically  evaluates acquired businesses for potential impairment\\nindicators Judgment regarding the existence of impairment  indicators is based\\non market conditions and operational  performance of the Company Future events\\ncould cause the Company to conclude that  impairment  indicators  exist and that\\ngoodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired  businesses is\\nCapitalized Software\\nThe carrying  value of  capitalized  software,  both  purchased  and  internally\\ndeveloped, is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators Future\\nevents could cause the Company to conclude that impairment  indicators exist and\\nthat capitalized software is impaired.\\nThe Company  has  established  deferred  income tax assets and  liabilities  for\\ntemporary  differences  between the financial reporting bases and the income tax\\nbases of its  assets and  liabilities  at enacted  tax rates  expected  to be in\\neffect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled The Company has\\nrecognized  as a deferred  tax asset the tax  benefits  associated  with  losses\\nrelated to  operations,  which are  expected to result in a future tax  benefit.\\nRealization  of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate\\nsufficient  future  taxable  income so that these assets will be  realized The\\nfactors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization  include the\\nforecast of future  taxable  income and available tax planning  strategies  that\\ncould be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn December 2004, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued SFAS\\nNo123 (Revised  2004),  \"Share-Based  Payment\" (SFAS  123(R)) This Statement\\nrevises  SFAS No.123 by  eliminating  the option to account for  employee

value of those awards (the  \"fair-value-based\"  method).\\nThe Company is adopting  SFAS 123(R)  effective  July 4, 2005 using the modified\\nprospective  method The impact of adopting  SFAS 123(R) cannot be predicted at\\nthis time  because  it will  depend on the  levels of  share-based  compensation\\ngranted in the future;  however,  had the Company  adopted  SFAS 123(R) in prior\\nperiods,

issued by the Committee of  Sponsoring\\n           Organizations  of   the  Treadway  Commission  (the  COSO criteria).\\n           1-800-FLOWERS.COM,  Inc.\\'s  management is responsible for maintaining\\n           effective  internal  control over  financial  reporting and  for  its\\n           assessment of  the effectiveness  of internal  control over financial\\n           reporting  Our  responsibility  is   to  express   an   opinion  on\\n           management\\'s  assessment and an  opinion on the effectiveness  of the\\n           Company\\'s internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based on our\\n           We  conducted  our  audit in  accordance  with  the standards  of the\\n           Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United States) Those\\n           standards  require that  we plan  and perform  the  audit  to  obtain\\n           reasonable  assurance  about whether  effective internal control over\\n           financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all material respectsOur\\n           audit  included  obtaining  an understanding of internal control over\\n           financial  reporting,  evaluating  management\\'s  assessment,  testing\\n           and  evaluating  the design  and operating  effectiveness of internal\\n           control, and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered\\n           necessary  in the circumstancesWe  believe that  our audit provides\\n           a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\n           A company\\'s  internal control  over  financial reporting is a process\\n           designed  to provide  reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability\\n           of  financial  reporting and  the preparation of financial statements\\n           for  external  purposes   in  accordance  with   generally   accepted\\n           accounting  principlesA company\\'s internal  control over  financial\\n           reporting  includes those  policies and  procedures that (1)  pertain\\n           to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately\\n           and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of\\n           the company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance  that transactions are\\n           recorded as necessary to  permit preparation  of financial statements\\n           in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that\\n           receipts  and expenditures of  the company  are  being  made  only in\\n           accordance  with authorizations of  management  and  directors of the\\n           company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\\n           timely detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\\n           the  company\\'s  assets that  could have  a  material  effect  on  the\\n           financial statements.\\n           Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial\\n           reporting may not prevent or detect  misstatementsAlso, projections\\n           of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods  are subject  to\\n           the risk that  controls may  become inadequate  because of changes in\\n           conditions,  or  that  the degree of compliance  with the policies or\\n           procedures may deteriorate.\\n           As  indicated in  the  accompanying  Management\\'s  Report on Internal\\n           Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A, management\\'s  assessment\\n           of  and  conclusion on  the  effectiveness  of internal control  over\\n           financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Cheryl &\\n           Coand  The Winetasting Network,  which are  included  in the Fiscal\\n           2005 consolidated financial statements of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, INCand\\n           Subsidiaries and constituted 8.3% of total assets as of July 3, 2005,\\n

revenues  for the  fiscal year  then  endedOur  audit  of  internal\\n           control  over  financial  reporting  of  1-800-FLOWERS.COM, INC and\\n           Subsidiaries  also did  not include  an  evaluation  of  the internal\\n           control over  financial reporting of Cheryl & Coand The Winetasting\\n           Network.\\n           In  our opinion, management\\'s assessment that 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, INC.\\n           and Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial\\n           reporting  as  of  July 3, 2005, is fairly  stated, in  all  material\\n           respects, based  on  the COSO  criteriaAlso, in our opinion, 1-800-\\n           FLOWERS.COM,  INC and  Subsidiaries  maintained,  in  all  material\\n           respects, effective internal control

gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is\\ndetermined on a specific identification basis.\\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\\nThe recorded amounts of the Company\\'s cash and equivalents, short-term\\ninvestments, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate\\ntheir fair values principally because of the short-term nature of these items.\\nThe fair value of investments, including available-for-sale securities, is based\\non quoted market prices where availableThe fair value of the Company\\'s\\nlong-term obligations are estimated based on the current rates offered to the\\nCompany for obligations of similar terms and maturitiesUnder this method, the\\nCompany\\'s fair value of long-term obligations was not significantly different\\nthan

consist principally of cash and equivalents,\\ninvestments and accounts receivableThe Company maintains cash and equivalents\\nand investments with high credit, quality financial

million and $1.4 million at\\nJuly 3, 2005 and June 27, 2004, respectively) have been recorded based upon\\nprevious experience and management\\'s evaluation.\\n

shipping charges, less discounts, returns and creditsNet revenues are\\nrecognized upon product shipment.\\nCost of revenues consists primarily of florist fulfillment costs (fees paid\\ndirectly to florists and fees paid to wire service entities that serve as\\nclearinghouses for floral orders, net of wire service rebates), the cost of\\nfloral and non-floral merchandise sold from inventory or through third parties,\\nand associated costs including inbound and outbound shipping charges.\\nAdditionally, cost of revenues includes labor and facility costs related to\\ndirect-to-consumer merchandise production operations, as well as facility costs\\non properties that are sublet to the Company\\'s franchisees.\\nMarketing and Sales\\nMarketing and sales expense consists primarily of

entry, customer service,\\nfulfillment and database systemsCosts associated with the acquisition or\\ndevelopment of software for internal use are capitalized if the software is\\nexpected to have a useful life beyond one year and amortized over the software\\'s\\nuseful life, typically three yearsCosts associated with repair, maintenance or\\nthe development of Web site content are expensed as incurred as the useful lives\\nof such software modifications are less than one year.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThe Company\\'s employee stock based compensation plans are described more fully\\nin Note 9Employee stock option plans are accounted for under the intrinsic\\nvalue recognition and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board\\nOpinion (\"APB\") No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to EmployeesAs all options\\nissued had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the\\nunderlying common stock on the date of grant and the related number of shares\\ngranted is fixed at that point in time, no compensation expense was recognized.\\nHad compensation expense for the plans been determined based on the fair value\\nof the options on the grant date, consistent with Statement of Financial\\nAccounting Standards (\"SFAS\") No123, \"Accounting for Stock-Based\\nCompensation,\" the Company\\'s net income and earnings per common share would have\\n                                      F-8\\nNet income (loss) per share:\\n         (1)  During fiscal 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all\\n              unvested stock options awarded to employees and officers which had\\n              an exercise price greater than $10.00 per shareOptions to\\n              purchase approximately 0.8 million shares became exercisable\\n              immediately as a result of the vesting accelerationThe Company\\n              sought to balance the benefit of eliminating the requirement to\\n              recognize compensation expense in future periods with the need to\\n              continue to motivate employee performance through previously\\n              issued, but currently unvested, stock option grantsWith those\\n              factors being considered, management determined it to be\\n              appropriate to accelerate only those unvested stock options where\\n              the strike price was reasonably in excess of the Company\\'s then\\n              current stock price.\\n              The effect of the acceleration was an increase in pro-forma stock\\n              based employee compensation expense for the year ended July 3,\\n              2005 of $3.0 million ($0.05 per basic and diluted share)As the\\n              Company will be adopting SFAS 123R, \"Share-Based Payment,\" in the\\n              first quarter of fiscal 2006, the decision to accelerate the\\n              vesting of the identified stock options will reduce the Company\\'s\\n              share-based compensation expense of approximately $2.1 million in\\n              fiscal 2006 and $0.9 million in fiscal 2007.\\n         (2)  During fiscal 2004, FAS 123 stock based compensation is net of the\\n              income tax benefit of $6.1 million, associated with the removal of\\n              the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets arising from\\n              employee stock option exercises.\\nComprehensive Income\\nFor the years ended July 3, 2005, June 27, 2004 and June 29, 2003, the Company\\'s\\ncomprehensive income was equal to the respective net income for each of the\\nNet Income Per Share\\nBasic net income per common share is computed using the weighted-average number\\nof common shares outstanding during the periodDiluted net income per share is\\ncomputed using the weighted-average number of common and dilutive common\\nequivalent shares (consisting primarily of employee stock options) outstanding\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS\\nNo123 (Revised 2004), \"Share-Based Payment\" (SFAS 123(R))This Statement\\nrevises SFAS No.123 by eliminating the option to account for employee stock\\n                                      F-9\\noptions under APB No25 and generally requires companies to recognize the cost\\nof employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based\\non the grant-date fair value of those awards (the \"fair-value-based\" method).\\nThe Company is adopting SFAS 123(R) effective July 4, 2005 using the modified\\nprospective methodThe impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) will be consistent with\\nthe impact in the proforma disclosure, excluding the effect of the option\\nacceleration presented above.\\nCertain balances in the prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform\\nwith the presentation in the current fiscal year.\\nNote 3Acquisitions\\nThe Company  accounts for its business  combinations in accordance with SFAS No.\\n141, \"Business Combinations,\" which addresses financial accounting and reporting\\nfor business  combinations and requires that all such  transactions be accounted\\nfor using the purchase  method Under the  purchase  method of  accounting  for\\nbusiness combinations, the aggregate purchase price for the acquired business is\\nallocated  to the  assets  acquired  and

and\\nChief  Executive  Officer,  acquired a single  retail  florist in New York City,\\nwhich he  subsequently  expanded to a 14-store  chain Thereafter,  the Company\\nmodified  its  business  strategy to take  advantage  of the rapid  emergence of\\ntoll-free callingThe Company acquired the right to use the toll-free telephone\\nnumber  1-800-FLOWERS,  adopted  it as  its  corporate  identity  and  began  to\\naggressively  build a national brand around itThe Company  believes it was one\\nof the first companies to embrace this new way of conducting business.\\nTo support the growth of its toll-free business and to provide superior customer\\nservice, the Company developed an operating infrastructure that incorporated the\\nbest available technologies Over time, the Company implemented a sophisticated\\ntransaction   processing   system  that   facilitated   rapid  order  entry  and\\nfulfillment, an advanced telecommunications system and multiple customer service\\ncenters to handle increasing call volume.\\nTo enable the Company to deliver products  reliably  nationwide on a same-day or\\nnext-day basis and to market  pre-selected,  high-quality  floral products,  the\\nCompany created  BloomNet(R),  a nationwide network including  independent local\\nflorists selected for their high-quality products, superior customer service and\\norder fulfillment and delivery capabilities.\\nThe Company\\'s  online  presence has enabled it to expand the number and types of\\nproducts it can effectively offer to its customersAs a result, the Company

inaccurate\\nassumptions relevant to our businessThese are factors that, individually or in\\nthe aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from\\nexpected  and  historical  results We note  these  factors  for  investors  as\\npermitted by the Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995You should\\nunderstand  that it is not  possible  to predict or identify  all such  factors.\\nConsequently,  you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion\\nof all potential risks and uncertainties.\\nThe Company\\'s operating results may fluctuate,  and this fluctuation could cause\\nfinancial results to be below expectations The Company\\'s operating results may\\nfluctuate  from  period to period  for a number of  reasons In  budgeting  the\\nCompany\\'s  operating  expenses for the foreseeable  future,  the Company assumes\\nthat revenues will continue to grow;  however,  some of the Company\\'s  operating\\nexpenses  are fixed in the  short  term Sales of the  Company\\'s  products  are\\nseasonal,  concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter,  due to the Thanksgiving\\nand Christmas-time  holidays,  and the second calendar quarter,  due to Mother\\'s\\nDay and Administrative  Professionals\\'  WeekIn anticipation of increased sales\\nactivity  during  these  periods,  the  Company  hires a  significant  number of\\ntemporary  employees to supplement its permanent staff and the Company increases\\nits inventory levelsIf revenues during these periods do not meet the Company\\'s\\nexpectations,  it may not generate  sufficient revenue to offset these increased\\ncosts and its operating results may suffer.\\n                                       11\\nThe Company\\'s  quarterly  operating results may significantly  fluctuate and you\\nshould not rely on them as an  indication of its future  results The Company\\'s\\nfuture revenues and results of operations may  significantly  fluctuate due to a\\ncombination of factors,  many of which are outside of management\\'s  controlThe\\nmost important of these factors include:\\n        o seasonality;\\n        o the retail economy;\\n        o the timing and effectiveness of marketing programs;\\n        o the timing of the introduction of new products and services;\\n        o the Company\\'s ability to find and maintain reliable sources for\\n          certain of its products;\\n        o the timing and effectiveness of capital expenditures;\\n        o the Company\\'s ability to enter into or renew online marketing\\n          agreements; and\\n        o competition.\\nThe Company may be unable to reduce operating  expenses quickly enough to offset\\nany  unexpected  revenue  shortfall If the Company has a shortfall  in revenue\\nwithout a corresponding reduction to its expenses, operating results may suffer.\\nThe Company\\'s operating results for any particular quarter may not be indicative\\nof  future  operating  results You  should  not  rely  on   quarter-to-quarter\\ncomparisons  of results of operations  as an indication of the Company\\'s  future\\nperformance It is  possible  that  results  of  operations  may be  below  the\\nexpectations  of public  market  analysts and  investors,  which could cause the\\ntrading price of the Company\\'s Class A common stock to fall.\\nConsumer  spending on flowers,  gifts and other products sold by the Company may\\nvary  with  general  economic   conditions  If  general  economic   conditions\\ndeteriorate and the Company\\'s  customers have less disposable income,  consumers\\nmay spend less on its products and its quarterly operating results may suffer.\\nIf the Company\\'s  customers do not find its expanded  product  lines  appealing,\\nrevenues  may not grow and net  income  may  decrease The  Company\\'s  business\\nhistorically  has focused on offering floral and  floral-related  gift products.\\nAlthough the Company has been successful in its expanded product lines including\\nplants, gift baskets, popcorn, gourmet food and wine, unique or specialty gifts,\\nhome and garden  accessories,  and children\\'s  gifts,  it expects to continue to\\nincur significant costs in marketing these products If the Company\\'s customers\\ndo not  continue  to find its  product  lines  appealing,  the  Company  may not\\ngenerate  sufficient  revenue to offset  its  related  costs and its  results of\\noperations may be negatively impacted.\\nIf the Company fails to develop and maintain its brands,  it may not increase or\\nmaintain its customer base or its revenuesThe Company must continue to develop\\nand maintain the  1-800-FLOWERS.COM  brands to expand its customer  base and its\\nrevenues In addition,  the Company has introduced and acquired other brands in\\nthe past, and may continue to do so in the futureThe Company believes that the\\nimportance  of  brand  recognition  will  increase  as it  expands  its  product\\nofferings Many of the  Company\\'s  customers  may not be aware of the Company\\'s\\nnon-floral  products If the Company fails to advertise and market its products\\neffectively,  it may not  succeed  in  establishing  its  brands  and  may  lose\\ncustomers leading to a reduction of revenues.\\nThe Company\\'s  success in promoting and enhancing the  1-800-FLOWERS.COM  brands\\nwill also depend on its success in providing its customers high-quality products\\nand a high level of customer serviceIf the Company\\'s customers do not perceive\\nits  products  and   services  to  be  of  high   quality,   the  value  of  the\\n1-800-FLOWERS.COM  brands would be diminished and the Company may lose customers\\nand its revenues may decline.\\nA failure to establish and maintain strategic online relationships that generate\\na  significant  amount  of  traffic  could  limit the  growth  of the  Company\\'s\\nbusiness Although  the  Company  expects a  significant  portion of its online\\ncustomers  will continue to come  directly to its Website,  it will also rely on\\nthird party Web sites, search engines and affililates with which the Company has\\nstrategic  relationships  for traffic If these  third-parties do not attract a\\nsignificant number of visitors, the Company may not receive a significant number\\nof online  customers  from  these  relationships  and its  revenues  from  these\\nrelationships  may  decrease  or  remain  flat There  continues  to be  strong\\n                                       12\\ncompetition  to  establish  or  maintain  relationships  with  leading  Internet\\ncompanies,   and  the  Company  may  not  successfully   enter  into  additional\\nrelationships,  or renew existing ones beyond their current  terms The Company\\nmay also be required to pay  significant  fees to maintain  and expand  existing\\nrelationships The  Company\\'s  online  revenues may suffer if it does not enter\\ninto  new  relationships  or  maintain   existing   relationships  or  if  these\\nrelationships do not result in traffic sufficient to justify their costs.\\nIf local  florists and other  third-party  vendors do not fulfill  orders to the\\nCompany\\'s  customers\\'  satisfaction,  customers  may not shop  with the  Company\\nagain In many cases,  floral  orders  placed by the  Company\\'s  customers  are\\nfulfilled  by local  independent  florists,  a majority  of which are members of\\nBloomNet The Company  does  not  directly  control any of these  florists In\\naddition,  many of the non-floral  products sold by the Company are manufactured\\nand delivered to its customers by independent  third-party vendorsIf customers\\nare dissatisfied  with the performance of the local florist or other third-party\\nvendors,  they may not utilize the Company\\'s services when placing future orders\\nand its revenues may decrease.\\nIf a florist  discontinues  its  relationship  with the Company,  the  Company\\'s\\ncustomers  may  experience  delays in service or declines in quality and may not\\nshop with the  Company  again Many of the  Company\\'s  arrangements  with local\\nflorists for order  fulfillment  may be  terminated  with 10 days  notice If a\\nflorist  discontinues  its  relationship  with the Company,  the Company will be\\nrequired to obtain a suitable  replacement  located in the same geographic area,\\nwhich may cause delays in delivery or a decline in quality,  leading to customer\\ndissatisfaction and loss of customers.\\nIf a significant amount of customers are not satisfied with their purchase,  the\\nCompany will be required to incur substantial costs to issue refunds, credits or\\nreplacement  products The Company  offers its  customers  a 100%  satisfaction\\nguarantee on its productsIf customers are not satisfied with the products they\\nreceive,  the Company will either  replace the product for the customer or issue\\nthe customer a refund or credit The Company\\'s  net income would  decrease if a\\nsignificant number of customers request replacement products, refunds or credits\\nand the Company is unable to pass such costs onto the supplier.\\nIncreased  shipping costs and labor stoppages may adversely  affect sales of the\\nCompany\\'s  products Many of the Company\\'s  products are delivered to customers\\neither directly from the manufacturer or from the Company\\'s  fulfillment centers\\nlocated in California,  Illinois,  New York, Ohio and Virginia The Company has\\nestablished  relationships with Federal Express, United Parcel Service and other\\ncommon  carriers for the delivery of these  products If these carriers were to\\nincrease  the prices they charge to ship the  Company\\'s  goods,  and the Company\\npasses these  increases on to its customers,  its customers  might choose to buy\\ncomparable  products  locally to avoid  shipping  charges In  addition,  these\\ncarriers  may  experience  labor  stoppages,  which could  impact the  Company\\'s\\nability to deliver  products on a timely basis to our  customers  and  adversely\\naffect its customer relationships.\\nIf the Company fails to continuously improve its web site, it may not attract or\\nretain customers If potential or existing  customers do not find the Company\\'s\\nWeb site a  convenient  place to shop,  the  Company  may not  attract or retain\\ncustomers  and its sales may suffer To encourage  the use of the Company\\'s web\\nsite, it must continuously  improve its accessibility,  content and ease of use.\\nCustomer  traffic and the  Company\\'s  business  would be  adversely  affected if\\ncompetitors\\'  web sites are perceived as easier to use or better able to satisfy\\nCompetition in the floral, plant, gift basket,  gourmet food and wine, specialty\\ngift,  children\\'s toys and games and home and garden industries is intense and a\\nfailure to respond to competitive pressure could result in lost revenues There\\nare many  companies  that  offer  products  in these  categories In the floral\\ncategory, the Company\\'s competitors include:\\n        o retail floral shops, some of which maintain toll-free telephone\\n          numbers and web sites;\\n        o online floral retailers;\\n        o catalog companies that offer floral products;\\n        o floral telemarketers and wire services; and\\n        o supermarkets, mass merchants and specialty gift retailers with floral\\n          departments.\\nSimilarly,  the   plant,  gift  basket,  gourmet   food,  cookie,  candy,  wine,\\nspecialty  gift,  children\\'s  toys and home and  garden  categories  are  highly\\ncompetitive Each of these categories  encompasses a wide range of products and\\n                                       13\\nis highly  fragmented Products in these  categories  may be  purchased  from a\\nnumber of outlets, including mass merchants,  retail shops, online retailers and\\nmail-order catalogs.\\nCompetition  is  intense  and the  Company  expects  it to  increase Increased\\ncompetition could result in:\\n        o price reductions, decreased revenue and lower profit margins;\\n        o loss of market share; and\\n        o increased marketing expenditures.\\nThese and other  competitive  factors could  materially and adversely affect the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations.\\nIf the Company does not accurately predict customer demand for its products,  it\\nmay lose customers or experience  increased  costsIn the past, the Company did\\nnot need to  maintain a  significant  inventory  of  products However,  as the\\nCompany expands the volume of non-floral products offered to its customers,  the\\nCompany will be required to increase inventory levels and the number of products\\nmaintained in its warehouses If the Company overestimates  customer demand for\\nits products, excess inventory and outdated merchandise could accumulate,  tying\\nup working capital and potentially  resulting in reduced warehouse  capacity and\\ninventory  losses  due  to  damage,  theft  and  obsolescence If  the  Company\\nunderestimates  customer demand, it may disappoint customers who may turn to its\\ncompetitors Moreover,  the strength of the  1-800-FLOWERS.COM  brands could be\\ndiminished due to misjudgments in merchandise selection.\\nIf the supply of flowers for sale becomes  limited,  the price of flowers  could\\nrise or flowers may be unavailable and the Company\\'s  revenues and gross margins\\ncould  decline A variety  of  factors  affect  the  supply of  flowers  in the\\ncountry-regionplaceUnited States and the price of the Company\\'s floral products.\\nIf the supply of flowers available for sale is limited due to weather conditions\\nor other  factors,  prices for flowers  could rise and  customer  demand for the\\nCompany\\'s floral products may be reduced,  causing revenues and gross margins to\\ndecline Alternatively,  the  Company  may not be able to obtain  high  quality\\nflowers in an amount  sufficient  to meet  customer  demand Even if available,\\nflowers from  alternative  sources may be of lesser  quality  and/or may be more\\nexpensive than those currently offered by the Company.\\nMost of the  flowers  sold in the United  States  are grown by  farmers  located\\nabroad, primarily in Colombia, Ecuador and Holland, and the Company expects that\\nthis will continue in the futureThe availability and price of flowers could be\\naffected by a number of factors affecting these regions, including:\\n        o import duties and quotas;\\n        o agricultural limitations and restrictions to manage pests and disease;\\n        o changes in trading status;\\n        o economic uncertainties and currency fluctuations;\\n        o severe weather;\\n        o work stoppages;\\n        o foreign government regulations and political unrest; and\\n        o trade restrictions, including United States retaliation against\\n          foreign trade practices.\\nThe Company\\'s franchisees may damage its brands or increase its costs by failing\\nto  comply  with  its  franchise  agreements  or its  operating  standards The\\nCompany\\'s  franchise  business is governed  by its  Uniform  Franchise  Offering\\nCirculars,  franchise  agreements and applicable franchise lawIf the Company\\'s\\nfranchisees do not comply with its established  operating standards or the terms\\nof the franchise agreements,  the  1-800-FLOWERS.COM  brands may be damagedThe\\nCompany may incur significant  additional costs,  including  time-consuming  and\\nexpensive  litigation,  to enforce its rights  under the  franchise  agreements.\\nAdditionally,  the Company is the primary  tenant on certain  leases,  which the\\nfranchisees  sublease  from  the  Company If a  franchisee  fails  to meet its\\nobligations  as subtenant,  the Company could incur  significant  costs to avoid\\ndefault under the primary leaseFurthermore,  as a franchiser,  the Company has\\nobligations to its franchiseesFranchisees may challenge the performance of

lack of security  over the  Internet may cause  Internet  usage to decline and\\ncause the Company to expend  capital and resources to protect  against  security\\nbreaches A significant  barrier to  electronic  commerce over the Internet has\\nbeen  the  need  for  secure   transmission  of  confidential   information  and\\ntransaction  information Internet  usage could decline if any  well-publicized\\ncompromise of security occurredAdditionally,  computer \"viruses\" may cause the\\nCompany\\'s  systems to incur delays or experience  other  service  interruptions.\\nSuch  interruptions  may materially  impact the Company\\'s ability to operate its\\nbusiness If a  computer  virus  affecting  the  Internet  in general is highly\\npublicized or  particularly  damaging,  the Company\\'s  customers may not use the\\nInternet  or may be  prevented  from  using the  Internet,  which  would have an\\nadverse  effect on its  revenues As a result,  the  Company may be required to\\nexpend capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate these problems.\\nUnexpected system  interruptions caused by system failures may result in reduced\\nrevenues and harm to

governing  intellectual  property  ownership and  infringement,  copyright,\\ntrademark,  trade secret,  obscenity,  libel,  employment,  personal privacy and\\nother issues is uncertain and

establish  procedures  to disclose  and\\nnotify users of privacy and  security  policies,  obtain  consent from users for\\ncollection and use of information  and provide users with the ability to access,\\ncorrect and delete personal information stored by the CompanyThese regulations\\nmay also  include  enforcement  and redress  provisions Moreover,  even in the\\nabsence  of  those

resulted in a consent  decree\\nunder which an Internet  company  agreed to establish  programs to implement the\\nprinciples   noted  above  The  Company  may  become  a  party  to  a

states be\\nsuccessful  in imposing  broader  guidelines  to state  sales and use taxes In\\naddition to the Company\\'s retail store operations, the Company collects sales or\\nother similar taxes in states where the Company\\'s  online and  telephonic  sales\\nchannels have applicable  nexusOur customer service and fulfillment  networks,\\nand any further  expansion of those  networks,  along with other  aspects of our\\nevolving  business,  may result in additional sales and use tax  obligations A\\nsuccessful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other\\ntaxes on the sale of merchandise could result in substantial tax liabilities for\\npast sales,  decrease our ability to compete  with  traditional  retailers,  and\\notherwise harm our business.\\nCurrently,  decisions  of the U.S Supreme  Court  restrict the  imposition  of\\nobligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales\\nmade  over the  Internet However,  a  number  of  states,  as well as the U.S.\\nCongress,  have  been  considering  various  initiatives  that  could  limit  or\\nsupersede the Supreme Court\\'s position regarding sales and use taxes on Internet\\nsalesIf any of these initiatives addressed the Supreme Court\\'s  constitutional\\nconcerns  and  resulted  in a  reversal  of its  current  position,  we could be\\nrequired to collect  additional sales and use taxesThe imposition by state and\\nlocal   governments  of  various  taxes  upon  Internet  commerce  could  create\\nadministrative burdens for us and could decrease our future sales.\\nA failure to integrate  our  acquisitions  may cause the results of the acquired\\ncompany  to  suffer as well as the  results  of the  Company The  Company  has\\nopportunistically acquired a number of companies over the past several yearsAs\\npart of the acquisition  process,  the Company embarks upon a project management\\neffort to integrate the

 may have to divert\\nvaluable resources to oversee and manage the acquisitions,  the Company may have\\nto expend  additional  investments in the acquired company to upgrade  personnel\\nand/or

perishable food and alcoholic beverage\\nproducts,  home and garden products, or children\\'s toys may expose it to product\\nliability  claims in the event  that the use or  consumption  of these  products\\nresults in  personal  injury Although  the  Company  has not  experienced  any\\nmaterial  losses due to product  liability  claims to date, it may be a party to\\nproduct  liability  claims in the  future and incur  significant  costs in their\\ndefense Product liability claims often create negative publicity,  which could\\nmaterially damage the Company\\'s reputation and its brands Although the Company\\nmaintains  insurance  against  product  liability  claims,  its  coverage may be\\ninadequate to cover any liabilities it may incur.\\nThe wine industry is subject to governmental regulation The alcoholic beverage\\nindustry is subject to extensive specialized  regulation under state and federal\\nlaws and regulations, including the following matters: licensing; the payment of\\nexcise taxes; advertising,  trade and pricing practices; product labeling; sales\\nto minors and intoxicated persons; changes in officers, directors,  ownership or\\ncontrol; and, relationships among product producers, importers,  wholesalers and\\nretailersWhile the Company believes that it is in material compliance with all\\napplicable laws and regulations,  in the event that it should be determined that\\nthe Company is not in compliance with any applicable  laws or  regulations,  the\\nCompany could become subject to cease and desist orders, injunctive proceedings,\\ncivil fines, license revocations and other penalties which could have a material\\nadverse effect on the Company\\'s business and its results of operations.\\nIn addition, the alcoholic beverage industry is subject to potential legislation\\nand  regulation  on a  continuous  basis  including  in such areas as direct and\\nInternet  sales of alcohol Certain  states still  prohibit the sale of alcohol\\ninto their jurisdictions from out of state wineries and/or retailers There can\\nbe no assurance  that new or revised laws or  regulations,  increased  licensing\\nfees,  specialized  taxes  or  other  regulatory  requirements  will  not have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\\'s business and its results of operations.\\n                                       17\\nWhile,  to date,  the  Company  has been  able to  obtain  and  retain  licenses\\nnecessary  to sell wine at retail,  the failure to obtain  renewals or otherwise\\nretain such licenses in one or more of the states in which the Company  operates\\nwould have a material  adverse effect on the Company\\'s  business and its results\\nof  operations The Company\\'s  growth  strategy for its wine business  includes\\nexpansion into additional  states;  however,  there can be no assurance that the\\nCompany will be successful in obtaining the required  permits or licenses in any\\nadditional  states From time to time,  the Company may introduce new marketing\\ninitiatives,  which may be expected to undergo regulatory scrutinyThere can be\\nno assurance that such initiatives will not be stymied by regulatory criticism.\\nThe Company is dependent on common carriers to deliver its wine  shipments The\\nCompany primarily uses FedEx and UPS to deliver its wine shipments If FedEx or\\nUPS were to  terminate  delivery  services  for  alcoholic  beverages in certain\\nstates, as it did in 1999 in Florida, Nevada and Connecticut,  the Company would\\nlikely  incur  significantly  higher  shipping  rates that would have a material\\nadverse effect on the Company\\'s  business and its results of operations If any\\nstate prohibits or limits  intrastate  shipping of alcoholic  beverages by third\\nparty  couriers,  the Company would likely incur  significantly  higher shipping\\nrates that would have a material  adverse  effect on the Company\\'s  business and\\nits results of operations.\\nThere are various health issues regarding wine consumption Since 1989, federal\\nlaw has required  health-warning labels on all alcoholic beverages Although an\\nincreasing  number of research  studies  suggest that health benefits may result\\nfrom the  moderate  consumption  of wine,  these  suggestions  have been  widely\\nchallenged  and a number of groups  advocate  increased  governmental  action to\\nrestrict  consumption  of  alcoholic  beverages Restrictions  on the  sale and\\nconsumption  of wine or  increases  in the taxes  imposed on wine in response to\\nconcerns  regarding  health  issues  may have a material  adverse  effect on the\\nCompany\\'s business and operating  results There can be no assurance that there\\nwill not be legal or regulatory  challenges to the industry as a whole,  and any\\nsuch legal or  regulatory  challenge may have a material  adverse  effect on the\\nCompany\\'s business and results of operations.\\nThe price at which the  Company\\'s  Class A common stock will trade may be highly\\nvolatile and may fluctuate substantiallyThe stock market has from time to time\\nexperienced  price and volume  fluctuations that have affected the market prices\\nof securities, particularly securities of companies with Internet operationsAs\\na result, investors may experience a material decline in the market price of the\\nCompany\\'s  Class  A  common  stock,   regardless  of  the  Company\\'s   operating\\nperformanceIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of\\na particular company\\'s securities,  securities class action litigation has often\\nbeen brought against that company The Company may become involved in this type\\nof  litigation  in the future Litigation  of this type is often  expensive and\\ndiverts management\\'s attention and resources, and as such, could have a material\\nadverse effect on the Company\\'s business and its results of

adjusted  for\\ndepreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income\\ntaxes and other  non-cash  charges,  which in total  amounted to $26.1  million,\\noffset in part by increases in  inventory  due to lead times  required to source\\nlower cost  foreign  products,  and  decreases  in accounts  payable and accrued\\nNet cash used in  investing  activities  of $110.7  million  for the fiscal year\\nended July 2, 2006 was primarily  attributable  to funding  acquisitions  ($96.9\\nmillion), including Wind & Weather ($5.0 million)  and  Fannie  May  Confections\\nBrands, Inc($91.9 million), as well as capital expenditures, primarily related\\nto the Company\\'s technology infrastructure,  offset in part by net proceeds from\\nthe sale of the Company\\'s short-term investments.\\nNet cash  provided by financing  activities of $80.6 million for the fiscal year\\nended July 2, 2006, was due primarily to bank  borrowings  against the Company\\'s\\n2006  Credit  Facility  which was used to fund the  acquisition  of  Fannie  May\\nConfections Brands,  Incin May 2006, as well as net proceeds received upon the\\nexercise  of  employee

stock,  which were  placed in\\ntreasury, for approximately $1.3 million.\\nOn May 1,  2006,  the  Company  entered  into a $135.0  million  secured  credit\\nfacility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a group of\\nlenders (the \"2006 Credit Facility\")The 2006 Credit Facility includes an $85.0\\nmillion term loan and a $50.0  million  revolving  credit  facility,  which bear\\ninterest at LIBOR plus 0.625% to 1.125%,  with pricing  based upon the Company\\'s\\nleverage  ratio At closing,  the Company  borrowed  $85.0  million of the term\\nfacility  to  acquire  all  of the  outstanding  capital  stock  of  Fannie  May\\nConfections  Brands,  IncThe Company is required to pay the outstanding  term\\nloan in quarterly installments, with the final installment

in  order  to fund  pre-holiday\\nmanufacturing and inventory purchases.\\nThe Company has historically utilized cash generated from operations to meet its\\ncash  requirements,  including  all  operating,  investing  and  debt  repayment\\nactivities Due to the Company\\'s continued expansion into non-floral  products,\\nincluding the aforementioned acquisitions of Fannie May Confections Brands, Inc.\\nthe Company  expects to utilize its existing $50.0 million line of credit during\\nits fiscal first and second quarter to fund working capital requirements,  which\\nhave  increased  during this time period as a result of increased  inventory and\\npre-holiday manufacturing requirements.\\nAt July 2, 2006, the Company\\'s contractual obligations consist of:\\n(*) Other cash obligations  consist primarily  of online  marketing  contractual\\n(**) Purchase  commitments consist primarily of inventory and equipment purchase\\norders made in the ordinary course of business.\\n                                       32\\nOn May 12, 2005,  the  Company\\'s  Board of  Directors  increased  the  Company\\'s\\nauthorization  to  repurchase  the  Company\\'s  Class A  common  stock  up to $20\\nmillion,  from the previous authorized limit of $10 million Any such purchases\\ncould  be made  from  time to time in the  open  market  and  through  privately\\nnegotiated  transactions,  subject to general market conditions The repurchase\\nprogram  will be financed  utilizing  available  cash As of July 2, 2006,  the\\nCompany had repurchased  1,510,050 shares of common stock for $11.1 million,  of\\nwhich $1.3  million and $9.8  million was  repurchased  during the fiscal  years\\nending July 2, 2006 and July 3, 2005, respectively.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe Company\\'s  discussion and analysis of its financial  position and results of\\noperations   are  based   upon  the   consolidated   financial   statements   of\\n1-800-FLOWERS.COM,  Inc.,  which  have been  prepared  in  accordance  with U.S.\\ngenerally  accepted  accounting  principles The preparation of these financial\\nstatements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\\nreported  amount of assets,  liabilities,  revenue  and  expenses,  and  related\\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilitiesOn an ongoing basis, management\\nevaluates  its  estimates,  including  those  related  to  revenue  recognition,\\ninventory and long-lived assets,  including goodwill and other intangible assets\\nrelated  to  acquisitions Management  bases its  estimates  and  judgments  on\\nhistorical  experience  and on various  other  factors  that are  believed to be\\nreasonable  under the  circumstances,  the  results  of which form the basis for\\nmaking  judgments  about the carrying values of assets and  liabilities Actual\\nresults  may  differ  from  these  estimates  under  different   assumptions  or\\nconditions Management  believes the following  critical  accounting  policies,\\namong  others,  affect its more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used in\\npreparation of its consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet  revenues  are  generated  by  online,  telephonic  and  retail  fulfillment\\noperations and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise, service or\\noutbound shipping charges, less discounts, returns and creditsNet revenues are\\nrecognized upon product shipmentShipping terms are FOB shipping point.\\nAccounts Receivable\\nThe Company  maintains  allowances  for doubtful  accounts for estimated  losses\\nresulting  from the inability of its customers or  franchisees  to make required\\npayments If the financial  condition of the Company\\'s customers or franchisees\\nwere to  deteriorate,  resulting  in an  impairment  of  their  ability  to make\\npayments, additional allowances may be required.\\nThe Company  states  inventory at the lower of cost or market In assessing the\\nrealization  of  inventories,  we are  required to make  judgments  as to future\\ndemand  requirements and compare that with inventory levelsIt is possible that\\nchanges in consumer  demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable  value\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the\\nnet assets  acquired  and is  evaluated  annually  for  impairment The cost of\\nintangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of\\neconomic benefits consumed, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated periods\\nbenefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years.\\nThe Company performs an annual impairment test as of the first day of its fiscal\\nfourth  quarter,  or earlier if indicators  of potential  impairment  exist,  to\\nevaluate goodwillGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the\\nreporting unit exceeds its estimated fair valueIn assessing the recoverability\\nof  goodwill,  the Company  reviews  both  quantitative  as well as  qualitative\\nfactors to support its assumptions with regard to fair valueJudgment regarding\\nthe  existence  of  impairment  indicators  is based on  market  conditions  and\\noperational performance of the CompanyFuture events could cause the Company to\\nconclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible\\nassets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.\\n                                       33\\nCapitalized Software\\nThe carrying  value of  capitalized  software,  both  purchased  and  internally\\ndeveloped, is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators Future\\nevents could cause the Company to conclude that impairment  indicators exist and\\nthat capitalized software is impaired.\\nStock-based Compensation\\nSFAS No123R requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based\\non the fair value of the award on the date of grantThe Company  determines the\\nfair value of stock  options  issued by using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing\\nmodelThe Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model considers a range of assumptions\\nrelated to  volatility,  dividend  yield,  risk-free  interest rate and employee\\nexercise behavior Expected  volatilities are based on historical volatility of\\nthe Company\\'s stock priceThe dividend yield is based on historical  experience\\nand future  expectations The  risk-free  interest  rate is derived from the US\\nTreasury  yield curve in effect at the time of grant The  Black-Scholes  model\\nalso  incorporates  expected  forfeiture  rates,  based on historical  behavior.\\nDetermining  these  assumptions  are  subjective and complex,  and therefore,  a\\nchange in the  assumptions  utilized  could impact the  calculation  of the fair\\nvalue of the  Company\\'s  stock  options Prior  to July 3,  2005,  the  Company\\nfollowed  APB  No 25,  and  related  interpretations Under  APB No 25,  no\\nstock-based  compensation  expense was recognized related to the Company\\'s stock\\noption program, as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market\\nvalue of the underlying common stock price on the date of grant.\\nThe Company  has  established  deferred  income tax assets and  liabilities  for\\ntemporary  differences  between the financial reporting bases and the income tax\\nbases of its  assets and  liabilities  at enacted  tax rates  expected  to be in\\neffect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled The Company has\\nrecognized  as a deferred  tax asset the tax  benefits  associated  with  losses\\nrelated to  operations,  which are  expected to result in a future tax  benefit.\\nRealization  of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate\\nsufficient  future  taxable  income so that these assets will be  realized The\\nfactors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization  include the\\nforecast of future  taxable  income and available tax planning  strategies  that\\ncould be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn July 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (\"FASB\")  issued FASB\\nInterpretation  No48, \"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\" (\"FIN 48\").\\nFIN  48  applies  to all  tax  positions  accounted  for  under  SFAS  no 109,\\n\"Accounting  for  Income  Taxes\" and  defines  the  confidence  level that a tax\\nposition must meet in order to be recognized  in the financial  statements The\\ninterpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if\\nit is  \"more-likely-than-not\"  to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the\\nreporting dateIf a tax position is not considered \"more-likely-than-not\" to be\\nsustained then no benefits of the position are to be recognizedFIN 48 requires\\nadditional  disclosures and is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal\\nyear beginning after December 15, 2006The Company is currently  evaluating the\\neffect  that the  adoption  of FIN 48 will have on its  consolidated  results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\n

preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S generally\\naccepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and\\nassumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements  and\\naccompanying notesActual results could differ from those estimates.\\nCash and Equivalents\\nCash and equivalents  consist of demand deposits with banks, highly liquid money\\nmarket  funds,  United  States  government   securities,   overnight  repurchase\\nagreements  and  commercial  paper with  maturities of three months or less when\\nInventories  are  valued  at the lower of cost or  market  using  the  first-in,\\nfirst-out method of accounting.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nProperty,  plant and  equipment  is  recorded  at cost  reduced  by  accumulated\\ndepreciation Depreciation  expense is  recognized  over the assets\\'  estimated\\nuseful  lives  using  the  straight-line   method  Amortization  of  leasehold\\nimprovements  and

To date, there\\nhas been no impairment of these assets.\\nThe cost of intangible  assets with  determinable  lives is amortized to reflect\\nthe pattern of economic benefits  consumed,  on a straight-line  basis, over the\\nestimated periods benefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years.\\nDeferred Catalog Costs\\nThe Company  capitalizes the costs of producing and  distributing  its catalogs.\\nThese  costs are  amortized  in direct  proportion  with  actual  sales from the\\ncorresponding  catalog  over a period not to exceed  26-weeks Included  within\\nother assets was $4.3 million and $3.7 million at July 2, 2006 and July 3, 2005,\\nrespectively, relating to prepaid catalog costs.\\nThe Company considers all of its debt and equity securities,  for which there is\\na determinable fair market value and no restrictions on the Company\\'s ability to\\nsell  within  the  next 12  months,  as  available-for-sale Available-for-sale\\nsecurities are carried at fair value,  with unrealized gains and losses reported\\nas a separate  component of  stockholders\\'  equity For the years ended July 2,\\n2006, July 3, 2005 and June 27, 2004, there were no significant unrealized gains\\nor losses Realized  gains and losses are  included in other  income The cost\\nbasis  for  realized  gains  and  losses  on  available-for-sale  securities  is\\ndetermined on a specific identification basis.\\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\\nThe  recorded  amounts  of  the  Company\\'s  cash  and  equivalents,   short-term\\ninvestments,  receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate\\ntheir fair values  principally  because of the short-term nature of these items.\\nThe fair value of investments, including available-for-sale securities, is based\\non  quoted  market  prices  where  available The fair  value of the  Company\\'s\\nlong-term  obligations  are estimated  based on the current rates offered to the\\nCompany for obligations of similar terms and maturities Under this method, the\\nCompany\\'s fair value of long-term  obligations was not  significantly  different\\nthan the carrying values at July 2, 2006 and July 3, 2005.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nFinancial  instruments  that  potentially  subject  the  Company to  significant\\nconcentrations  of credit  risk  consist  principally  of cash and  equivalents,\\ninvestments and accounts receivable The Company maintains cash and equivalents\\nand investments with high credit, quality financial institutions Concentration\\nof credit  risk with  respect to  accounts  receivable  are  limited  due to the\\nCompany\\'s large number of customers and their  dispersion  throughout the United\\nStates,  and the fact that a substantial  portion of receivables  are related to\\nbalances owed by major credit card companies Allowances  relating to consumer,\\ncorporate and franchise  accounts  receivable  ($2.3 million and $1.5 million at\\nJuly 2, 2006 and July 3,  2005,  respectively)  have been  recorded  based  upon\\nprevious experience and management\\'s evaluation.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet  revenues  are  generated  by  online,  telephonic  and  retail  fulfillment\\noperations and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise, service or\\noutbound shipping charges, less discounts, returns and creditsNet revenues are\\nrecognized upon product shipmentShipping terms are FOB shipping point.\\nCost of revenues  consists  primarily  of florist  fulfillment  costs (fees paid\\ndirectly to florists),  the cost of floral and non-floral  merchandise sold from\\ninventory or through third parties,  and associated costs including  inbound and\\noutbound  shipping  charges Additionally,  cost of revenues includes labor and\\nfacility costs related to direct-to-consumer merchandise production operations.\\n                                      F-7\\nMarketing and Sales\\nMarketing and sales expense  consists  primarily of advertising  and promotional\\nexpenditures, catalog costs, online portal and search expenses, retail store and\\nfulfillment  operations  (other than costs  included in cost of  revenues),  and\\ncustomer  service  center  expenses,  as well as the  operating  expenses of the\\nCompany\\'s   departments   engaged  in  marketing,   selling  and   merchandising\\nThe Company

million and $91.1 million for the\\nyears ended July 2, 2006, July 3, 2005 and June 27, 2004, respectively.\\nTechnology and Development\\nTechnology and development  expense consists  primarily of

costs  related  to  the  Company\\'s  order  entry,   customer   service,\\nfulfillment  and database  systems Costs  associated  with the  acquisition or\\ndevelopment  of software  for internal  use are  capitalized  if the software is\\nexpected to have a useful life beyond one year and amortized over the software\\'s\\nuseful life, typically three yearsCosts associated with repair, maintenance or\\nthe development of Web site content are expensed as incurred as the useful lives\\nof such software modifications are less than one year.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nThe Company\\'s  employee stock based  compensation plans are described more fully\\nin Note 9Prior to July 4, 2005,  as permitted  under SFAS No123, the Company\\naccounted for its stock option plans  following the  recognition and measurement\\nprinciples of Accounting  Principles Board (APB) Opinion No25, \"Accounting for\\nStock  Issued  to  Employees,\"  and  related  interpretations Accordingly,  no\\nstock-based  compensation had been reflected in net income for stock options, as\\nall  options  granted had an  exercise  price  equal to the market  value of the\\nunderlying  common  stock on the date of grant and the related  number of shares\\ngranted was fixed at that point in time.\\nIn December 2004, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued SFAS\\nNo 123(R),  \"Share-Based  Payment.\"  This  Statement  revised  SFAS No123 by\\neliminating  the option to account for employee  stock  options under APB No25\\nand requires  companies to recognize the cost of employee  services  received in\\nexchange for awards of equity  instruments based on the grant-date fair value of\\nthose awards (the \"fair-value-based\" method).\\nEffective  July  4,  2005,  the  Company  adopted  the  fair  value  recognition\\nprovisions of SFAS No123(R) using the modified prospective application method.\\nUnder this transition  method,  compensation  cost recognized on a straight-line\\nbasis during the year ended July 2, 2006 includes  amounts of: (a)  compensation\\ncost of all  stock-based  payments  granted  prior to, but not yet vested as of,\\nJuly 4, 2005 (based on grant-date  fair value  estimated in accordance  with the\\noriginal  provisions of SFAS No123, and previously  presented in the pro-forma\\nfootnote  disclosures),  and (b) compensation cost for all stock-based  payments\\ngranted subsequent to July 3, 2005 (based on the grant-date fair value estimated\\nin accordance with the new provision of SFAS No123(R))In accordance with the\\nmodified  prospective method,  results for prior periods have not been restated.\\nPrior to the Company\\'s adoption of SFAS No123(R), benefits of tax deduction in\\nexcess of recognized  compensation  costs were reported as operating cash flows.\\nSFAS No 123(R)  requires  excess tax benefits be reported as a financing  cash\\ninflow  rather than as a  reduction  of taxes  paid There were no  significant\\nexcess tax benefits for the year ended July 2, 2006.\\n                                      F-8\\nThe following table summarizes the effect of adopting SFAS No123(R) as of\\n<S>                                                                          <C>\\n      Impact on basic and diluted net (loss) income per common\\n      (*) Excludes the amortization of restricted stock awards in the\\n          amount of $0.6 million during the year ended July 2, 2006\\n          ($0.4 million, net of tax).\\nCompensation  expense related to the amortization of restricted stock awards was\\nrecognized  prior to the  implementation  of SFAS No123(R) Total stock based\\ncompensation  expense,  which  includes  both  expense  from stock  options  and\\nrestricted  stock  awards,  totaled $4.3 million ($3.2  million,  net of tax, or\\n$0.05 per diluted share) during the year ended July 2, 2006.\\nUnder the modified  prospective  application  method,  results for prior periods\\nhave not been restated to reflect the effects of  implementing  SFAS No123(R).\\nThe following pro-forma  information,  as required by SFAS No148,  \"Accounting\\nfor Stock-Based  Compensation-Transition  and  Disclosure,  an amendment of FASB\\nStatement No123,\" is presented for  comparative  purposes and  illustrates the\\neffect on net income and net income per common  share for the periods  presented\\nas if the Company had applied the fair value recognition  provisions of SFAS No.\\n123 to stock-based employee compensation prior to July 4, 2005:\\n                     Net income (loss) per share:\\n                                      F-9\\n     (1) During fiscal 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all unvested\\n         stock options awarded to employees  and officers  which had an exercise\\n         price greater than $10.00 per shareOptions to  purchase approximately\\n         0.8 million shares became  exercisable immediately  as a result  of the\\n         vesting  accelerationThe  Company sought to  balance  the  benefit of\\n         eliminating the requirement to recognize compensation expense in future\\n         periods  with the need to  continue to  motivate  employee  performance\\n         through previously issued, but currently unvested, stock option grants.\\n         With  those factors being considered, management  determined it  to  be\\n         appropriate  to accelerate only those  unvested stock options where the\\n         strike  price was reasonably  in excess  of the Company\\'s  then current\\n         stock price.\\n         The effect of the acceleration was an increase in pro-forma stock based\\n         employee compensation expense for the  year  ended July 3, 2005 of $3.0\\n         million ($0.05 per basic and diluted share)The decision to accelerate\\n         the vesting of the identified  stock options will  reduce the Company\\'s\\n         share-based  compensation  expense  of approximately  $2.1  million  in\\n         fiscal 2006 and $0.9 million in fiscal 2007.\\n     (2) During  fiscal  2004, FAS 123  stock based  compensation is net of  the\\n         income tax benefit of $6.1 million, associated  with the removal of the\\n         valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  arising from employee stock\\n         option exercises.\\nComprehensive Income\\nFor the years ended July 2, 2006, July 3, 2005 and June 27, 2004, the  Company\\'s\\ncomprehensive  income  was equal to  the respective  net income for each  of the\\nNet Income Per Share\\nBasic net income per common share is computed using the weighted-average  number\\nof common shares outstanding during the period Diluted net income per share is\\ncomputed  using  the  weighted-average  number  of common  and  dilutive  common\\nequivalent shares (consisting primarily of employee stock options and restricted\\nstock awards) outstanding during the period.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn July 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (\"FASB\")  issued FASB\\nInterpretation  No48, \"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\" (\"FIN 48\").\\nFIN  48  applies  to all  tax  positions  accounted  for  under  SFAS  No 109,\\n\"Accounting  for  Income  Taxes\" and  defines  the  confidence  level that a tax\\nposition must meet in order to be recognized  in the financial  statements The\\ninterpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if\\nit is  \"more-likely-than-not\"  to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the\\nreporting dateIf a tax position is not considered \"more-likely-than-not\" to be\\nsustained then no benefits of the position are to be recognizedFIN 48 requires\\nadditional  disclosures and is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal\\nyear beginning after December 15, 2006The Company is currently  evaluating the\\neffect  that the  adoption  of FIN 48 will have on its  consolidated  results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\nCertain balances in the  prior fiscal years  have been  reclassified to  conform\\nwith the presentation in the current fiscal year.\\n                                      F-10\\nNote 3 - Net Income Per Common Share\\nThe following table sets forth the

the  modified\\n            prospective  application   method The  impact of  the   adoption,\\n            which reduced net income per common share for the fiscal year ended\\n            July 2, 2006 by $0.05 is described in further detail in Note 2.\\n            Note (2): During the fiscal year ended June 27,2004, the Company\\n            recorded an income tax benefit of $19.2 million ($0.28 per diluted\\n            share)due to the removal of the Company\\'s valuation allowance on its\\n            deferred tax assets which consisted primarily of net operating loss\\n

June 27, 2004, respectively were excluded from the\\n            calculation of net income per share on a diluted basis as their\\n            effect is anti-dilutive.\\nNote 4Acquisitions\\nThe Company  accounts for its business  combinations in accordance with SFAS No.\\n141, \"Business Combinations,\" which addresses financial accounting and reporting\\nfor business  combinations and requires that all such  transactions be accounted\\nfor using the purchase  method Under the  purchase  method of  accounting  for\\nbusiness combinations, the aggregate purchase price for the acquired business is\\nallocated  to the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  based  on  their\\nestimated fair values at the acquisition date.\\nAcquisition of Fannie May Confections Brands, Inc.\\nOn May 1, 2006,  the Company  acquired  all of the  outstanding  common stock of\\nFannie May  Confections  Brands,  Inc (hereafter  referred  to as \"Fannie  May\\nConfections  Brands\"), a manufacturer and multi-channel  retailer and wholesaler\\nof premium  chocolate and other  confections  under the  well-known  Fannie May,\\nHarry London and Fanny Farmer brands The acquisition,  for

foot\\nmanufacturing  facility in North Canton, Ohio and 52 Fannie May retail stores in\\nthe Chicago area, where the chocolate brand has been a tradition since 1920The\\npurchase price is subject to \"earn-out\"  incentives which amount to a maximum of\\n$4.5  million  during the year ending July 1, 2007 and $1.5  million  during the\\nyear ending June 29,  2008,  upon  achievement  of specified

F-11\\nAs  described   further  under  \"Long-Term   Debt,\"  in  order  to  finance  the\\nacquisition,  on May 1, 2006, the Company  entered into a $135.0 million secured\\ncredit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as  administrative  agent, and a\\ngroup of lenders (the \"2006 Credit Facility\")The 2006 Credit Facility includes\\nan $85.0 million term loan and a $50.0 million  revolving  facility,  which bear\\ninterest at LIBOR plus 0.625% to 1.125%,  with pricing  based upon the Company\\'s\\nleverage  ratio At closing,  the Company  borrowed  $85.0  million of the term\\nfacility  to  acquire  all  of the  outstanding  capital  stock  of  Fannie  May\\nConfections Brands.\\nAcquisition of Wind & Weather\\nOn October 31, 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of\\nWind & Weather, a Fort Bragg, California based direct marketer of weather-themed\\ngifts, with annual revenues of approximately  $14.4 million during its then most\\nrecently  completed  fiscal year ended March 31,  2005 The  purchase  price of\\napproximately  $5.2 million,  including  acquisition costs, was funded utilizing\\nthe  Company\\'s  line of credit  which was  repaid  during the  Company\\'s  second\\nquarter utilizing cash generated from operations, and excludes the assumption of\\nWind & Weather\\'s $1.2 million balance on its seasonal  working capital lineThe\\nCompany has since  relocated  the  operations  of Wind & Weather to its Madison,\\nVirginia facility, and terminated operations in California.\\nThe  Company  is in the  process of  obtaining  independent  appraisals  for the\\npurpose of  allocating  the purchase  price to  individual  assets  acquired and\\nliabilities  assumed as a result of the  acquisition  of

telephone number at that location is (516) 237-6000.\\nThe Origins of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM\\nThe Company\\'s  operations  began in 1976 when James FMcCann,  its Chairman and\\nChief  Executive  Officer,  acquired a single  retail  florist in New York City,\\nwhich he  subsequently  expanded to a 14-store  chain Thereafter,  the Company\\nmodified  its  business  strategy to take  advantage  of the rapid  emergence of\\ntoll-free callingThe Company acquired the right to use the toll-free telephone\\nnumber  1-800-FLOWERS,  adopted  it as  its  corporate  identity  and  began  to\\naggressively  build a national brand around itThe Company  believes it was one\\nof the first companies to embrace this new way of conducting business.\\nIn order to support the growth of its toll-free business and to provide superior\\ncustomer  service,  the  Company  developed  an  operating  infrastructure  that\\nincorporated the best available technologiesOver time, the Company implemented\\na sophisticated transaction processing system that facilitated rapid order entry\\nand fulfillment,  an advanced  telecommunications  system and multiple  customer\\nservice centers to handle increasing call volume.\\nTo enable the Company to deliver products  reliably  nationwide on a same-day or\\nnext-day basis and to market  pre-selected,  high-quality  floral products,  the\\nCompany created  BloomNet(R),  a nationwide network including  independent local\\nflorists selected for their high-quality products, superior customer service and\\norder fulfillment and delivery capabilities.\\nThe Company\\'s  online  presence has enabled it to expand the number and types of\\nproducts it can effectively offer to its customersAs a result, the Company has\\ndeveloped  relationships  with customers who purchase  products for both a broad\\nrange of  celebratory  gifting  occasions as well as for everyday  personal use.\\nSince 1995, the Company has broadened its product  offering to include  products\\nthat a customer could expect to find in a high-end flower shop, including a wide\\nassortment of cut flowers and plants, candy, balloons,  plush toys, giftware and\\ngourmet gift basketsIn addition,  the Company has further expanded its product\\n                                       1\\noffering  to  include  home  and  garden  merchandise  through  its  April  1998\\nacquisition of The Plow & Hearth, Inc.; unique and educational  children\\'s gifts\\nthrough its  acquisition of the HearthSong and Magic Cabin product lines in June\\n2001 and,  more  recently,  weather-themed  gifts and  instruments  through  the\\nacquisition   of  Wind  &  Weather  in  October  2005  The  Company  has  also\\nsignificantly  expanded  it\\'s  presence  in the  gourmet  food and gift  baskets\\ncategory through a combination of organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions\\nbeginning with the purchase of GreatFood.com, Incin November 1999, followed by\\nthe purchase of certain assets of The Popcorn  Factory in May 2002, the addition\\nof wine gifts through the  acquisition  of The  WineTasting  Network in November\\n2004,  the addition of

 many BloomNet  florists,  also are members of other floral\\nfulfillment  organizations The BloomNet agreements generally are cancelable by\\neither party with ten days notification and do not guarantee any orders,  dollar\\namounts or  exclusive  territories  from the Company to the  florist In fiscal\\n2001,  the Company  began  entering  into Order  Fulfillment  Agreement(s)  with\\nselected  BloomNet members to operate LFC\\'s in high volume markets to facilitate\\nthe fulfillment of the Company\\'s floral and gift orders, improving the economics\\nof florist  fulfilled  transactions,  and  improving  the  Company\\'s  ability to\\ncontrol  product  quality  and  branding In  consideration  of the  operator\\'s\\nsatisfactory  performance,  the  Company  agrees to use

or\\nother delivery options selected by the customer.\\nThe Company\\'s quarterly results may experience seasonal fluctuationsDue to the\\nCompany\\'s expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas\\nholiday  season,  which  falls  within  the  Company\\'s  second  fiscal  quarter,\\ngenerates the highest proportion of the Company\\'s annual revenues In addition,\\nas the result of a number of major floral gifting occasions,  including Mother\\'s\\nDay and  Administrative  Professionals  Week,  revenues  also  rise  during  the\\n                                       8\\nCompany\\'s  fiscal fourth quarter Finally,  results during the Company\\'s fiscal\\nfirst quarter are negatively impacted by the lack of major gift-giving holidays,\\nand the disproportionate amount of overhead incurred during this slow period.\\nThe growing  popularity and convenience of e-commerce has continued to give rise\\nto established businesses on the InternetIn addition to selling their products\\nover the  Internet,  many of these  retailers  sell  their  products  through  a\\ncombination of channels by maintaining a web site, a toll-free  phone number and\\nphysical locations Additionally, several of these merchants offer an expanding\\nvariety of products and some are  attracting an increasing  number of customers.\\nCertain mass  merchants  have  expanded  their  offerings  to include  competing\\nproducts and may continue to do so in the futureThese mass merchants,  as well\\nas other potential competitors, may be able to:\\n       o  undertake  more  extensive  marketing  campaigns for their  brands and\\n          services;\\n       o  adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and\\n       o  make more attractive offers  to potential  employees, distributors and\\n          retailers.\\nIn addition,  the Company faces intense  competition  in each of its  individual\\nproduct  categories In the floral  industry,  there are various  providers  of\\nfloral  products,  none of which is  dominant  in the  industry The  Company\\'s\\ncompetitors include:\\n       o  retail  floral  shops,  some  of which  maintain  toll-free  telephone\\n          numbers and web sites;\\n       o  online floral retailers;\\n       o  catalog companies that offer floral products;\\n       o  floral telemarketers and wire

gifts,\\nchildren\\'s toys and home and garden categories are highly  competitive Each of\\nthese categories  encompasses a wide range of products, is highly fragmented and\\nis served by a large number of companies, none of which is dominantProducts in\\nthese  categories  may be  purchased  from a number of outlets,  including  mass\\nmerchants,   telemarketers,   retail  specialty  shops,   online  retailers  and\\nmail-order catalogs.\\nThe Company  believes the strength of its brands,  product  selection,  customer\\nrelationships,  technology  infrastructure and fulfillment capabilities position\\nit to compete effectively against its current and potential  competitors in each\\nof its product categoriesHowever, increased competition could result in:\\n       o  price

time to time,  the Company may introduce new marketing\\ninitiatives,  which may be expected to undergo regulatory scrutinyThere can be\\nno assurance that such initiatives will not be stymied by regulatory criticism.\\nThe Company is dependent on common carriers to deliver its wine  shipments The\\ncompany uses UPS and FedEx to deliver its wine  shipments If UPS or FedEx were\\nto terminate delivery services for alcoholic  beverages in certain states, as it\\ndid in 1999 in Florida,  Nevada and Connecticut,  the Company would likely incur\\nsignificantly higher shipping rates that would have a material adverse effect on\\nthe Company\\'s business and its results of operations If any state prohibits or\\nlimits intrastate shipping of alcoholic  beverages by third party couriers,  the\\nCompany would likely incur significantly higher shipping rates that would have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\\'s business and its results of operations.\\nThere are various health issues regarding wine consumption Since 1989, federal\\nlaw has required  health-warning labels on all alcoholic beverages Although an\\nincreasing  number of research  studies  suggest that health benefits may result\\nfrom the  moderate  consumption  of wine,  these  suggestions  have been  widely\\nchallenged  and a number of groups  advocate  increased  governmental  action to\\nrestrict  consumption  of  alcoholic  beverages Restrictions  on the  sale and\\nconsumption  of wine or  increases  in the taxes  imposed on wine in response to\\nconcerns  regarding  health  issues  may have a material  adverse  effect on the\\nCompany\\'s business and operating  results There can be no assurance that there\\nwill not be legal or regulatory  challenges to the industry as a whole,  and

allocable to a specific\\n          category.\\n     (**) Performance  is  measured  based on  category  contribution  margin or\\n          category EBITDA,  reflecting only the direct controllable  revenue and\\n          operating expenses of the categoriesAs such, management\\'s measure of\\n          profitability  for these  categories  does not  include  the effect of\\n          corporate overhead,  described above, nor does it include depreciation\\n          and  amortization,  other income (net),  and income taxes Management\\n          utilizes EBITDA as a performance measurement tool because it considers\\n          such information a meaningful  supplemental measure of its performance\\n          and believes it is frequently used by the investment  community in the\\n          evaluation of companies with  comparable  market  capitalization The\\n          Company also uses EBITDA as one of the factors  used to determine  the\\n          total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive  officers\\n          and other employees The Company\\'s credit agreement uses EBITDA (with\\n          additional  adjustments) to measure  compliance with covenants such as\\n          interest  coverage  and debt  incurrence EBITDA  is also used by the\\n          Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidatesEBITDA\\n          has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in\\n          isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company\\'s  results as\\n          reported under GAAP Some of these  limitations  are: (a) EBITDA does\\n                                       28\\n          not  reflect  changes  in, or cash  requirements  for,  the  Company\\'s\\n          working  capital  needs;  (b) EBITDA does not reflect the  significant\\n          interest  expense,  or the  cash  requirements  necessary  to  service\\n          interest  or  principal  payments,  on the  Company\\'s  debts;  and (c)\\n          although  depreciation  and  amortization  are non-cash  charges,  the\\n          assets being  depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the\\n          future,  and EBITDA does not reflect  any cash  requirements  for such\\n          capital expendituresBecause of these limitations, EBITDA should only\\n          be used on a  supplemental  basis  combined  with  GAAP

of\\ncredit to fund working capital requirements related to pre-holiday manufacturing\\nand inventory purchasesAt July 1, 2007, the Company had no outstanding amounts\\nunder its revolving  credit  facility,  but  anticipates  borrowing  against the\\nfacility prior to the end of its first  quarter The Company  anticipates  that\\nsuch borrowings will peak during its fiscal second quarter,  before being repaid\\nprior to the end of that quarter.\\nOn May 12, 2005,  the  Company\\'s  Board of  Directors  increased  the  Company\\'s\\nauthorization  to  repurchase  the  Company\\'s  Class

contractual obligations consist of:\\n                                       37\\n(*) Purchase  commitments  consist  primarily of inventory,  equipment  purchase\\norders and online marketing agreements made in the ordinary course of business.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe Company\\'s  discussion and analysis of its financial  position and results of\\noperations   are  based   upon  the   consolidated   financial   statements   of\\n1-800-FLOWERS.COM,  Inc.,  which  have been  prepared  in  accordance  with U.S.\\ngenerally  accepted  accounting  principles The preparation of these financial\\nstatements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\\nreported  amount of assets,  liabilities,  revenue  and  expenses,  and  related\\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilitiesOn an ongoing basis, management\\nevaluates  its  estimates,  including  those  related  to  revenue  recognition,\\ninventory and long-lived assets,  including goodwill and other intangible assets\\nrelated  to  acquisitions Management  bases its  estimates  and  judgments  on\\nhistorical  experience  and on various  other  factors  that are  believed to be\\nreasonable  under the  circumstances,  the  results  of which form the basis for\\nmaking  judgments  about the carrying values of assets and  liabilities Actual\\nresults  may  differ  from  these  estimates  under  different   assumptions  or\\nconditions Management  believes the following  critical  accounting  policies,\\namong  others,  affect its more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used in\\npreparation of its consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet revenues are generated by E-commerce  operations  from the Company\\'s  online\\nand telephonic sales channels as well as other operations (retail/wholesale) and\\nprimarily  consist of the  selling  price of  merchandise,  service or  outbound\\nshipping  charges,  less  discounts,  returns  and  credits Net  revenues  are\\nrecognized upon product  shipment Shipping terms are FOB shipping  point Net\\nrevenues  generated by the Company\\'s  BloomNet Wire Service  operations  include\\nmembership  fees as well as other  products  and service  offerings to florists.\\nMembership fees are recognized  monthly in the period earned, and products sales\\nare recognized upon product shipment with shipping terms of FOB shipping point.\\nAccounts Receivable\\nThe Company  maintains  allowances  for doubtful  accounts for estimated  losses\\nresulting  from the inability of its customers or  franchisees  to make required\\npayments If the financial  condition of the Company\\'s customers or franchisees\\nwere to  deteriorate,  resulting  in an  impairment  of  their  ability  to make\\npayments, additional allowances may be required.\\nThe Company  states  inventory at the lower of cost or market In assessing the\\nrealization  of  inventories,  we are  required to make  judgments  as to future\\ndemand  requirements and compare that with inventory levelsIt is possible that\\nchanges in consumer  demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable  value\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the\\nnet assets  acquired  and is  evaluated  annually  for  impairment The cost of\\nintangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of\\neconomic benefits consumed, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated periods\\nbenefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years.\\nThe Company performs an annual impairment test as of the first day of its fiscal\\nfourth  quarter,  or earlier if indicators  of potential  impairment  exist,  to\\nevaluate goodwillGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the\\nreporting unit exceeds its estimated fair valueIn assessing the recoverability\\nof  goodwill,  the Company  reviews  both  quantitative  as well as  qualitative\\nfactors to support its assumptions with regard to fair valueJudgment regarding\\nthe  existence  of  impairment  indicators  is based on  market  conditions  and\\noperational performance of the CompanyFuture events could cause the Company to\\nconclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible\\nassets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.\\n                                       38\\nCapitalized Software\\nThe carrying  value of  capitalized  software,  both  purchased  and  internally\\ndeveloped, is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators Future\\nevents could cause the Company to conclude that impairment  indicators exist and\\nthat capitalized software is impaired.\\nStock-based Compensation\\nSFAS No123R requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based\\non the fair value of the award on the date of grantThe Company  determines the\\nfair value of stock  options  issued by using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing\\nmodelThe Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model considers a range of assumptions\\nrelated to  volatility,  dividend  yield,  risk-free  interest rate and employee\\nexercise behavior Expected  volatilities are based on historical volatility of\\nthe Company\\'s stock priceThe dividend yield is based on historical  experience\\nand future  expectations The  risk-free  interest  rate is derived from the US\\nTreasury  yield curve in effect at the time of grant The  Black-Scholes  model\\nalso  incorporates  expected  forfeiture  rates,  based on historical  behavior.\\nDetermining  these  assumptions  are  subjective and complex,  and therefore,  a\\nchange in the  assumptions  utilized  could impact the  calculation  of the fair\\nvalue of the Company\\'s stock options.\\nThe Company  has  established  deferred  income tax assets and  liabilities  for\\ntemporary  differences  between the financial reporting bases and the income tax\\nbases of its  assets and  liabilities  at enacted  tax rates  expected  to be in\\neffect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled The Company has\\nrecognized  as a deferred  tax asset the tax  benefits  associated  with  losses\\nrelated to  operations,  which are  expected to result in a future tax  benefit.\\nRealization  of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate\\nsufficient  future  taxable  income so that these assets will be  realized The\\nfactors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization  include the\\nforecast of future  taxable  income and available tax planning  strategies  that\\ncould be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn June 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (\"FASB\")  issued FASB\\nInterpretation  No48, \"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\" (\"FIN 48\").\\nFIN  48  applies  to all  tax  positions  accounted  for  under  SFAS  No 109,\\n\"Accounting  for  Income  Taxes\" and  defines  the  confidence  level that a tax\\nposition must meet in order to be recognized  in the financial  statements The\\ninterpretation requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if\\nit is  \"more-likely-than-not\"  to be sustained by the taxing authority as of the\\nreporting dateIf a tax position is not considered \"more-likely-than-not\" to be\\nsustained then no benefits of the position are to be recognizedFIN 48 requires\\nadditional  disclosures and is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal\\nyear beginning after December 15, 2006The Company is currently  evaluating the\\neffect  that the  adoption  of FIN 48 will have on its  consolidated  results of\\noperations and financial condition.\\nIn September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No157, \"Fair Value  Measurements\"\\n(\"Statement  No157\") which  defines fair value,  establishes  a framework  for\\nmeasuring fair value,  and expands  disclosures  about fair value  measurements.\\nStatement  No157 applies to other  accounting  pronouncements  that require or\\npermit fair value measurements and,  accordingly,  does not require any new fair\\nvalue  measurements Statement No157 is effective for fiscal years  beginning\\nafter November 15, 2007The transition adjustment of the difference between the\\ncarrying  amounts and the fair values of those financial  instruments  should be\\nrecognized  as a  cumulative-effect  adjustment  to retained  earnings as of the\\nbeginning  of the year of  adoption The company is  currently  evaluating  the\\nimpact of adopting the provisions of Statement No157.\\n                                       39\\nItem 7A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n          The Company\\'s  earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations

U.Sgovernment securities,  as well as from outstanding\\n          debtAs of July 1, 2007, the Company\\'s  outstanding  debt,  including\\n          current maturities, approximated $78.1 million, of which $76.5 million\\n          was variable rate debt Each 25 basis point change in interest  rates\\n          would  have  a  corresponding   effect  on  our  interest  expense  of\\n          approximately  $0.2  million  as of July 1,  2007 Under its  current\\n          policies,   the  Company  does  not  use  interest   rate   derivative\\n          instruments to manage exposure to

Presentation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM,\\nInc and its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries  (collectively,  the  \"Company\") All\\nsignificant  intercompany  accounts and  transactions  have been  eliminated  in\\nThe  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S generally\\naccepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and\\nassumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements  and\\naccompanying notesActual results could differ from those estimates.\\nCash and Equivalents\\nCash and equivalents  consist of demand deposits with banks, highly liquid money\\nmarket  funds,  United  States  government   securities,   overnight  repurchase\\nagreements  and  commercial  paper with  maturities of three months or less when\\nInventories  are  valued  at the lower of cost or  market  using  the  first-in,\\nfirst-out method of accounting.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nProperty,  plant and  equipment  is  recorded  at cost  reduced  by  accumulated\\ndepreciation Depreciation  expense is  recognized  over the assets\\'  estimated\\nuseful  lives  using  the  straight-line   method  Amortization  of  leasehold\\nimprovements  and capital leases are calculated using the  straight-line  method\\nover the shorter of the lease terms,  including  renewal options  expected to be\\n                                      F-6\\nexercised, or estimated useful lives of the improvementsEstimated useful lives\\nare   periodically   reviewed,   and  where   appropriate,   changes   are  made\\nprospectively The Company\\'s  property plant and equipment is depreciated using\\nthe following estimated lives:\\n                Buildings                                      40 years\\n                Leasehold Improvements                       3-10 years\\n                Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment            3-10 years\\n                Software                                      3-5 years\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived  intangibles are not amortized,  but are evaluated\\nannually for impairment The Company performs its annual  impairment test as of\\nthe  first day of its  fiscal  fourth  quarter,  or  earlier  if  indicators  of\\npotential  impairment  exist,  to  evaluate  goodwill Goodwill  is  considered\\nimpaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair\\nvalue In assessing the  recoverability  of goodwill,  the Company reviews both\\nquantitative  factors to support its  assumptions  with regard to fail valueTo\\ndate, there has been no impairment of these assets.\\nThe cost of intangible  assets with  determinable  lives is amortized to reflect\\nthe pattern of economic benefits  consumed,  on a straight-line  basis, over the\\nestimated periods benefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years.\\nDeferred Catalog Costs\\nThe Company  capitalizes the costs of producing and  distributing  its catalogs.\\nThese  costs are  amortized  in direct  proportion  with  actual  sales from the\\ncorresponding  catalog  over a period not to exceed  26-weeks Included  within\\nprepaid and other current  assets was $4.3 million at both July 1, 2007 and July\\n2, 2006, relating to prepaid catalog expenses.\\nThe Company considers all of its debt and equity securities,  for which there is\\na determinable fair market value and no restrictions on the Company\\'s ability to\\nsell  within  the  next 12  months,  as  available-for-sale Available-for-sale\\nsecurities are carried at fair value,  with unrealized gains and losses reported\\nas a separate  component of  stockholders\\'  equity For the years ended July 1,\\n2007, July 2, 2006 and July 3, 2005, there were no significant  unrealized gains\\nor losses Realized  gains and losses are  included in other  income The cost\\nbasis  for  realized  gains  and  losses  on  available-for-sale  securities  is\\ndetermined on a specific identification basis.\\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\\nThe  recorded  amounts  of  the  Company\\'s  cash  and  equivalents,   short-term\\ninvestments,  receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate\\ntheir fair values  principally  because of the short-term nature of these items.\\nThe fair value of investments, including available-for-sale securities, is based\\non  quoted  market  prices  where  available The fair  value of the  Company\\'s\\nlong-term  obligations,  the majority of which are carried at a variable rate of\\ninterest,  are  estimated  based on the current rates offered to the Company for\\nobligations of similar terms and  maturities Under this method,  the

Additionally,  cost of revenues includes labor and\\nfacility costs related to direct-to-consumer merchandise production operations.\\nMarketing and Sales\\nMarketing and sales expense  consists

Compensation\\nThe Company\\'s employee  stock-based  compensation plans are described more fully\\nin Note 11Prior to July 4, 2005, as permitted  under SFAS No123, the Company\\naccounted for its stock option plans  following the  recognition and measurement\\nprinciples of Accounting  Principles Board (APB) Opinion No25, \"Accounting for\\nStock  Issued  to  Employees,\"  and  related  interpretations Accordingly,  no\\nstock-based  compensation had been reflected in net income for stock options, as\\nall  options  granted had an  exercise  price  equal to the market  value of the\\nunderlying  common  stock on the date of grant and the related  number of shares\\ngranted was fixed at that point in time.\\nIn December 2004, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued SFAS\\nNo 123(R),  \"Share-Based  Payment.\"  This  Statement  revised  SFAS No123 by\\neliminating  the option to account for employee  stock  options under APB No25\\nand requires  companies to recognize the cost of employee  services  received in\\nexchange for awards of equity  instruments based on the grant-date fair value of\\nthose awards (the \"fair-value-based\" method).\\nEffective  July  4,  2005,  the  Company  adopted  the  fair  value  recognition\\nprovisions of SFAS No123(R) using the modified prospective application method.\\nUnder this transition  method,  compensation  cost recognized on a straight-line\\nbasis during the year ended July 2, 2006 includes  amounts of: (a)  compensation\\ncost of all  stock-based  payments  granted  prior to, but not yet vested as of,\\nJuly 4, 2005 (based on grant-date  fair value  estimated in accordance  with the\\noriginal  provisions of SFAS No123, and previously  presented in the pro-forma\\nfootnote  disclosures),  and (b) compensation cost for all stock-based  payments\\ngranted subsequent to July 3, 2005 (based on the grant-date fair value estimated\\nin accordance with the new provision of SFAS No123(R))In accordance with the\\nmodified  prospective method,  results for prior periods have not been restated.\\nPrior to the Company\\'s  adoption of SFAS No123(R),  benefits of tax deductions\\nin excess of  recognized  compensation  costs were  reported as  operating  cash\\nflows SFAS No123(R)  requires excess tax benefits be reported as a financing\\n                                      F-8\\ncash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid There were no significant\\nexcess tax benefits for the years ended July 1, 2007 or July 2, 2006.\\nThe amounts of stock-based compensation expense recognized in the periods\\npresented are as follows:\\nThe  amounts  above  include  the  impact of  recognizing  compensation  expense\\nrelating to stock options and restricted stock awards For the periods prior to\\nour  implementation  of SFAS 123(R) on July 4, 2005, only  compensation  expense\\nrelated to restricted  stock awards was  recognized  and included in general and\\nadministrative expenses.\\nStock-based  compensation  expense  has  not  been  allocated  between  business\\nsegments, but is reflected in Corporate(Refer to Note 14 - Business Segments)\\n                                      F-9\\nUnder the modified  prospective  application  method,  results for prior periods\\nhave not been restated to reflect the effects of  implementing  SFAS No123(R).\\nThe following  pro-forma  information is presented for comparative  purposes and\\nillustrates  the effect on net  income  and net income per common  share for the\\nperiods  presented  as

approximately\\n         0.8  million shares became  exercisable immediately  as a result of the\\n         vesting  accelerationThe  Company  sought to  balance the  benefit of\\n         eliminating the requirement to recognize compensation expense in future\\n         periods with the  need  to continue  to motivate  employee  performance\\n         through previously issued, but currently unvested, stock option grants.\\n         With  those factors  being considered,  management determined  it to be\\n         appropriate  to accelerate only  those unvested stock options where the\\n         strike  price was  reasonably  in excess of  the Company\\'s then current\\n         stock price.\\n         The effect of the acceleration was an increase in pro-forma stock based\\n

and\\nChief  Executive  Officer,  acquired a single  retail  florist in New York City,\\nwhich he  subsequently  expanded to a 14-store  chain Thereafter,  the Company\\nmodified  its  business  strategy to take  advantage  of the rapid  emergence of\\ntoll-free callingThe Company acquired the right to use the toll-free telephone\\nnumber  1-800-FLOWERS,  adopted  it as  its  corporate  identity  and  began  to\\naggressively  build a national brand around itThe Company  believes it was one\\nof the first companies to embrace this new way of conducting business.\\nIn order to support the growth of its toll-free business and to provide superior\\ncustomer  service,  the  Company  developed  an  operating  infrastructure  that\\nincorporated the best available technologiesOver time, the Company implemented\\na sophisticated transaction processing system that facilitated rapid order entry\\nand fulfillment,  an advanced  telecommunications  system and multiple  customer\\nservice centers to handle increasing call volume.\\nTo enable the Company to deliver products  reliably  nationwide on a same-day or\\nnext-day basis and to market  pre-selected,  high-quality  floral products,  the\\nCompany created  BloomNet(R),  a nationwide network including  independent local\\nflorists selected for their high-quality products, superior customer service and\\norder fulfillment and delivery capabilities.\\nThe Company\\'s  online  presence has enabled it to expand the number and types of\\nproducts it can effectively offer to its customersAs a result, the Company has\\ndeveloped  relationships  with customers who purchase  products for both a broad\\nrange of celebratory gifting occasions as well as for everyday personal useThe\\nCompany has broadened its product  offering to include  products that a customer\\ncould expect to find in a high-end florist shop,  including a wide assortment of\\n                                       1\\ncut flowers and

 tracking,  contests,   sweepstakes,   gift-giving\\nsuggestions  and  reminder   programs,   home  decorating  and  how-to-tips  and\\ninformation  about special  events and offers The Company has designed its web\\nsites to be fast,  secure and easy to use and allows customers to order products\\nwith minimal effort The Company\\'s web sites include the following key features\\nin addition to the variety of delivery and shipping  options (same day/next day)\\nand 24 hour/7 day customer service that are available to all its customers:\\nTechnology Infrastructure\\nThe Company  believes it has been and  continues to be a leader in  implementing\\nnew  technologies  and systems to give its customers the best possible  shopping\\nexperience,  whether online or over the telephoneThrough the use of customized\\nsoftware  applications,  the  Company  is able to  retrieve,  sort  and  analyze\\ncustomer  information  to enable it to better serve its customers and target its\\nproduct  offerings The Company\\'s online and telephonic orders are fed directly\\nfrom the Company\\'s  secure web sites,  or with the assistance of a gift advisor,\\ninto a transaction  processing  system which captures the required  customer and\\nrecipient  information The system  then  routes  the order to the  appropriate\\nCompany  warehouse,  or for florist fulfilled or drop-shipped  items,  selects a\\nvendor  to  fulfill  the  customer\\'s  order  and  electronically  transmits  the\\nnecessary   information   using   BloomLink(R),    the   Company\\'s   proprietary\\ncommunication system,  assuring timely deliveryIn addition, the Company\\'s gift\\nadvisors have electronic access to this system, enabling them to assist in order\\nfulfillment and subsequently track other customer and/or order information.\\nIn prior  years,  the  Company  has  invested  heavily  in  building  a scalable\\ntechnology  platform to support the Company\\'s  order volume growth The Company\\nemploys  a  combination  of  in-house   personnel  which   concentrate  on  core\\ncompetencies,  including  strategic  direction and system and project management\\nand  implementation However,  more  recently,  the Company  began  outsourcing\\ncertain  of its  programming  and  support  services  in order to  achieve  cost\\nefficiencies,  allowing the Company to focus its resources on customer  specific\\nprojects to ensure an enjoyable  shopping  experience  while providing  improved\\noperational flexibility, additional capacity and system redundancy.\\nThe Company\\'s technology  infrastructure,  primarily consisting of the Company\\'s\\nweb sites,  transaction  processing,  manufacturing  and  warehouse  management,\\ncustomer databases and  telecommunications  systems, is built and maintained for\\nreliability,  security,  scalability  and  flexibility To minimize the risk of\\nservice interruptions from unexpected component or  telecommunications  failure,\\nmaintenance  and  upgrades,  the  Company  has built  full  back-up  and  system\\nredundancies  into those  components of its systems that have been identified as\\ncritical The Company  plans to continue  to invest in  technologies  that will\\nimprove and expand its e-commerce and telecommunication capabilities and utilize\\nits informational technology expertise to improve the technology  infrastructure\\nof its  recently  acquired  businesses  to  accommodate  anticipated  growth and\\nimprove their customers\\' shopping experiences.\\nFulfillment and Manufacturing Operations\\nThe Company\\'s  customers  primarily place their orders either online or over the\\ntelephone The  Company\\'s  development  of a hybrid  fulfillment  system  which\\nenables the Company to offer same-day,  next-day and any-day delivery,  combines\\nthe use of BloomNet  (comprised of independent  florists operating retail flower\\nshops and LFC\\'s,  Company-owned  stores,  LFC\\'s, and franchise stores), with the\\nCompany-owned  distribution  centers and brand-name vendors who ship directly to\\nthe Company\\'s customers While providing a significant competitive advantage in\\n                                       7\\nterms of delivery options,  the Company\\'s  fulfillment system also has the added\\nbenefit  of  reducing  the  Company\\'s  capital   investments  in  inventory  and\\ninfrastructure All of the Company\\'s products are backed by a 100% satisfaction\\nguarantee, and the Company\\'s business is not dependent on any single third-party\\nTo ensure reliable and efficient  communication of online and telephonic  orders\\nto its  BloomNet  members and third party gift  vendors,  the Company  developed\\nBloomLink(R),  a proprietary  and secure  internet-based  communications  system\\nwhich is available to all BloomNet  members and  third-party  gift vendors The\\nCompany  also has the  ability to arrange for  international  delivery of floral\\nproducts through independent wire services and direct relationships.\\nThe  Company  intends  to  improve  its  fulfillment  capabilities  to make  its\\noperations more efficient by:\\n       o    strengthening relationships and increasing the number of its vendors\\n            and BloomNet member florists, as  appropriate, to ensure  geographic\\n            coverage and shorten delivery times;\\n       o    continuing to improve warehousing operations and  reduce fulfillment\\n            times in support of  its floral, gifts, gourmet food  and wines, and\\n            home product lines; and\\n       o    expanding the use of cross-dock logistics, and work with additional\\n            third  party  carriers to increase volume  capability and  utilizing\\n            cross  brand fulfillment capabilities to mitigate the impact of fuel\\n            cost increases.\\nFulfillment of products is as follows:\\nFlowers and Plants A majority of the Company\\'s  floral orders are fulfilled by\\none of the  Company\\'s  BloomNet  members,  allowing  the  Company to deliver its\\nfloral products on a same-day or next-day basis to ensure  freshness and to meet\\nits customers\\' need for immediate  gifting In addition,  the Company is better\\npositioned to ensure  consistent  product quality and  presentation  and offer a\\ngreater  variety of  arrangements,  which  creates a better  experience  for its\\ncustomers and gift recipients The Company selects retail florists for BloomNet\\nbased upon the florist\\'s design staff, facilities, quality of floral processing,\\nand delivery  capabilities and allocates orders to members within a geographical\\narea based on historical  performance of the florist in fulfilling  orders,  and\\nthe  number  of  BloomNet  florists  currently  serving  the area The  Company\\nregularly monitors BloomNet florists\\' performance and adherence to the Company\\'s\\nquality standards to ensure proper fulfillment.\\nThe Company\\'s  relationships with its BloomNet members are  non-exclusive Many\\nflorists,  including  many BloomNet  florists,  also are members of other floral\\nfulfillment  organizations The BloomNet agreements generally are cancelable by\\neither party with ten days notification and do not guarantee any orders,  dollar\\namounts or  exclusive  territories  from the Company to the  florist In fiscal\\n2001, the Company began entering into Order Fulfillment Agreements with selected\\nBloomNet  members to operate  LFC\\'s in high  volume  markets to  facilitate  the\\nfulfillment of the Company\\'s floral and gift orders,  improving the economics of\\nflorist fulfilled  transactions,  and improving the Company\\'s ability to control\\nproduct quality and branding In consideration  of the operator\\'s  satisfactory\\nperformance, the Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to forward orders with\\na specified  minimum  merchandise  value during each year of the agreement The\\nCompany has not granted an exclusive territory to any operator.\\nIn  certain  instances,  the  Company is  required  to  fulfill  orders  through\\nnon-BloomNet members, and transmits these orders to the fulfilling florist using\\nthe communication system of an independent wire service or via telephone.\\nIn addition to its florist designed product, the Company offers its customers an\\nalternative to florist  designed  products through its Fresh From Our Growers(R)\\nprogram,  and by providing  for a full array of products from bouquets to unique\\nfloral celebrity expert designed products.\\nAs of June 29, 2008, the Company operates 4 floral retail stores located in  New\\nYork and 1  fulfillment  center In  addition,  the Company has 104  franchised\\nstores, located primarily in California, Colorado, Florida, New Jersey, New York\\nand Texas Company-owned stores serve as local points of fulfillment and enable\\nthe Company to test new products and marketing programs.\\nGourmet Foods and Gift Baskets In order to take advantage of improved margins,\\nbetter control  quality and to offer premium branded  signature  products in the\\n                                       8\\nGourmet Food and Gift Baskets  product  category,  which was  identified  by the\\nCompany as one of its fastest  growing and most  profitable  product lines,  the\\nCompany  has  acquired  several  gourmet  food  retailers  with    manufacturing\\noperations The Company\\'s  premium  chocolates are manufactured and distributed\\nfrom its  200,000  square  foot  production  facility  in Akron,  Ohio,  and the\\nCompany\\'s  cookie and baked gifts are  fulfilled  from its  176,000  square foot\\nbaking and  distribution  center in Obetz,  Ohio,  while its premium popcorn and\\nrelated  snack  products  are shipped  from the  Company\\'s  148,000  square foot\\nmanufacturing  and distribution  center located in Lake Forest,  Illinois Most\\nwine gift and  fulfillment  services are provided  through the Company\\'s  52,000\\nsquare  foot  fulfillment  center in Napa,  California  and 42,000  square  foot\\nfulfillment  center in Albany, New YorkThe remainder of the Company\\'s wine and\\nwine-related  items are fulfilled by third-party gift vendors that ship products\\ndirectly to the  customer by next-day or other  delivery  options  chosen by the\\ncustomer In April 2008,  through the  acquisition of DesignPac  Gifts LLC, the\\nCompany  significantly  improved  its  gift  basket  fulfillment   capabilities.\\nInitially,  DesignPac\\'s  confection and fulfillment,  through its 249,000 square\\nfoot  distribution  center  located in Melrose Park, IL, will focus on wholesale\\noperations During  fiscal  2009,  the  Company  will  begin  to  leverage  the\\ncapabilities   of   DesignPac   to   enable   it   to   handle   its   expanding\\ndirect-to-consumer demand.\\nHome  and  Children\\'s  Gifts The  Company  packages  and  ships  its  home and\\nchildren\\'s gift products  primarily from three  locations;  (i) a 300,000 square\\nfoot  distribution  center located in Madison,  Virginia,  (ii) a 200,000 square\\nfoot  distribution  center in  Vandalia,  Ohio and (iii) a 140,000  square  foot\\ndistribution center in Reno, NevadaA smaller portion of the Company\\'s home and\\nchildren\\'s items are shipped by third-party  product suppliers using next-day or\\nother delivery options selected by the customer.\\nThe Company\\'s quarterly results may experience seasonal fluctuationsDue to the\\nCompany\\'s expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas\\nholiday  season,  which  falls  within  the  Company\\'s  second  fiscal  quarter,\\ngenerates the highest proportion of the Company\\'s annual revenues In addition,\\nas the result of a number of major floral gifting occasions,  including Mother\\'s\\nDay and  Administrative  Professionals  Week,  revenues  also  rise  during  the\\nCompany\\'s  fiscal fourth quarter Finally,  results during the Company\\'s fiscal\\nfirst quarter are negatively impacted by the lack of major gift-giving holidays,\\nand the disproportionate amount of overhead incurred during this slow period.\\nAdjusting for its  most recent  acquisitions,  during fiscal 2009, the Company\\'s\\nfiscal second quarter, its largest in terms of revenues,  is expected to account\\nfor approximately 38-40% of sales, followed by its fiscal fourth quarter,  which\\nis expected to account for 23-25% of sales, including the shift in the timing of\\nthe Easter  Holiday from Q3 during  fiscal 2008 to Q4 during  fiscal  2009 The\\nCompany\\'s fiscal third quarter is expected to account for  approximately  21-23%\\nof sales,  also  adjusting  for the  timing  of the  Easter  Holiday,  while the\\nCompany\\'s fiscal first quarter is expected to account for  approximately  14-16%\\nAccordingly,  a disproportionate amount of operating cash flows are generated in\\nthe  Company\\'s  fiscal  second  and  fourth  quarters In  preparation  for the\\nCompany\\'s second quarter holiday season, the Company significantly increases its\\ninventories, and therefore, corresponding cash requirements, which traditionally\\nhave been financed by cash flows from  operations and bank lines of credit,  are\\nhighest during the latter part of the Company\\'s  fiscal first  quarter,  peaking\\nwithin its second  fiscal  quarter The  Company  has  historically  repaid all\\nrevolving bank lines of credit with cash generated from operations, prior to the\\nend of the Company\\'s fiscal second quarter.\\nThe growing  popularity and convenience of e-commerce has continued to give rise\\nto established businesses on the InternetIn addition to selling their products\\nover the  Internet,  many of these  retailers  sell  their  products  through  a\\ncombination of channels by maintaining a web site, a toll-free  phone number and\\nphysical locations Additionally, several of these merchants offer an expanding\\nvariety of products and some are  attracting an increasing  number of customers.\\nCertain mass  merchants  have  expanded  their  offerings  to include  competing\\nproducts and may continue to do so in the futureThese mass merchants,  as well\\nas other potential competitors, may be able to:\\n                                       9\\n       o  undertake  more  extensive  marketing  campaigns for their  brands and\\n          services;\\n       o  adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and\\n       o  make more attractive offers  to potential  employees, distributors and\\n          retailers.\\nIn addition,  the Company faces intense  competition  in each of its  individual\\nproduct  categories In the floral  industry,  there are various  providers  of\\nfloral  products,  none of which is  dominant  in the  industry The  Company\\'s\\ncompetitors include:\\n       o  retail  floral  shops,  some  of which  maintain  toll-free  telephone\\n          numbers and web sites;\\n       o  online floral retailers;\\n       o  catalog companies that offer floral products;\\n       o  floral telemarketers and wire services; and\\n       o  supermarkets,  mass  merchants  and specialty  retailers  with  floral\\n          departments.\\nSimilarly,  the  plant,  gift  basket,  gourmet  foods and wine,  unique  gifts,\\nchildren\\'s toys and home and garden categories are highly  competitive Each of\\nthese categories  encompasses a wide range of products, is highly fragmented and\\nis served by a large number of companies, none of which is dominantProducts in\\nthese  categories  may be  purchased  from a number of outlets,  including  mass\\nmerchants,   telemarketers,   retail  specialty  shops,   online  retailers  and\\nmail-order catalogs.\\nThe Company  believes the strength of its brands,  product  selection,  customer\\nrelationships,  technology  infrastructure and fulfillment capabilities position\\nit to compete effectively against its current and potential  competitors in each\\nof its product categoriesHowever, increased competition could result in:\\n       o  price reductions, decreased revenues and lower profit margins;\\n       o  loss of market share; and\\n       o  increased marketing expenditures.\\nThese and other competitive  factors may adversely impact the Company\\'s business\\nand results of operations.\\nGovernment Regulation and Legal Uncertainties\\nThe  Internet  continues to evolve and there are laws and  regulations  directly\\napplicable to e-commerceLegislatures are also considering an increasing number\\nof  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to  the  Internet,  including  laws  and\\nregulations addressing:\\n       o  user privacy;\\n       o  connectivity;\\n       o  intellectual property;\\n       o  distribution;\\n       o  taxation;\\n       o  liabilities;\\n       o  antitrust; and\\n       o  characteristics and quality of products and services.\\nFurther, the growth and development of the market for online services may prompt\\nmore stringent  consumer  protection laws that may impose additional  burdens on\\nthose companies  conducting business onlineThe adoption of any additional laws\\nor  regulations  may impair  the growth of the  Internet  or  commercial  online\\nservicesThis could decrease the demand for the Company\\'s services and increase\\nits cost of doing  business Moreover,  the  applicability  to the  Internet of\\nexisting  laws  regarding  issues  like  property  ownership,  taxes,  libel and\\npersonal  privacy is uncertain Any new  legislation or regulation  that has an\\nadverse  impact  on the  Internet  or  the  application  of  existing  laws  and\\nregulations  to  the  Internet  could  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the\\nCompany\\'s business, financial condition and results of operations.\\n                                       10\\nStates or foreign countries might attempt to regulate the Company\\'s  business or\\nlevy  additional  sales or other taxes relating to its  activities Because the\\nCompany\\'s  products and services are available over the Internet anywhere in the\\nworld,  multiple

gift products.\\nAlthough the Company has been successful in its expanded product lines including\\nplants, gift baskets, popcorn, gourmet food and wine, unique or specialty gifts,\\nhome and garden  accessories,  and children\\'s  gifts,  it expects to continue to\\nincur significant costs in marketing these products If the Company\\'s customers\\ndo not  continue  to find its  product  lines

and its\\nrevenues In addition,  the Company has introduced and acquired other brands in\\nthe past, and may continue to do so in the futureThe Company believes that the\\nimportance  of  brand  recognition  will  increase  as it  expands  its  product\\nofferings Many of the  Company\\'s  customers  may not be aware of the Company\\'s\\nnon-floral  products If the Company fails to advertise and market its products\\neffectively,  it may not  succeed  in  establishing  its  brands  and  may  lose\\ncustomers leading to a reduction of revenues.\\nThe Company\\'s  success in promoting and

the  Company  expects a  significant  portion of its online\\ncustomers  will continue to come  directly to its website,  it will also rely on\\nthird party web sites, search engines and affililates with which the Company has\\nstrategic  relationships  for traffic If these  third-parties do not attract a\\nsignificant number of visitors, the Company may not receive a significant number\\nof

In\\naddition,  many of the non-floral  products sold by the Company are manufactured\\nand delivered to its customers by independent  third-party vendorsIf customers\\nare dissatisfied  with the

 its  relationship  with the Company,  the  Company\\'s\\ncustomers  may  experience  delays in service or declines in quality and may not\\nshop with the  Company  again Many of the  Company\\'s  arrangements  with local\\nflorists for order  fulfillment  may be  terminated by either party with 10 days\\nnoticeIf a florist discontinues its relationship with the Company, the Company\\nwill be required to obtain a suitable replacement located in the same geographic\\narea,  which may cause  delays in delivery  or a decline in quality,  leading to\\ncustomer dissatisfaction and loss of customers.\\nIf a significant number of customers are not satisfied with their purchase,  the\\nCompany will be required to incur substantial costs to issue refunds, credits or\\nreplacement  products The Company  offers its  customers  a 100%  satisfaction\\nguarantee on its productsIf customers are not satisfied with the products they\\nreceive,  the Company will either  replace the product for the customer or issue\\nthe customer a refund or credit The Company\\'s  net income would  decrease if a\\nsignificant number of customers request replacement products, refunds or credits\\nand the

the\\nCompany\\'s results of operations.\\nIf the Company does not accurately predict customer demand for its products,  it\\nmay lose customers or experience  increased  costsIn the past, the Company did\\nnot need to  maintain a  significant  inventory  of  products However,  as the\\nCompany expands the volume of non-floral products offered to its customers,  the\\nCompany will be required to increase inventory levels and the number of products\\nmaintained in its warehouses If the Company overestimates  customer demand for\\nits products, excess inventory and outdated merchandise could accumulate,  tying\\nup working capital and potentially  resulting in reduced warehouse  capacity and\\ninventory  losses  due  to  damage,  theft  and  obsolescence If  the  Company\\nunderestimates  customer demand, it may disappoint customers who may turn to its\\ncompetitors Moreover,  the strength of the  1-800-FLOWERS.COM  brands could be\\ndiminished due to misjudgments in merchandise selection.\\nIf the supply of flowers for sale becomes  limited,  the price of flowers  could\\nrise or flowers may be unavailable and the Company\\'s  revenues and gross margins\\ncould  decline A variety of factors affect the supply of flowers in the United\\nStates and the price of the Company\\'s floral products If the supply of flowers\\navailable for sale is limited due to weather conditions, farm closures, economic\\nconditions,  or other factors, prices for flowers could rise and customer demand\\nfor the Company\\'s  floral  products may be reduced,  causing  revenues and gross\\nmargins to  decline Alternatively,  the Company may not be able to obtain high\\nquality  flowers  in an  amount  sufficient  to meet  customer  demand Even if\\navailable,  flowers from alternative sources may be of lesser quality and/or may\\nbe more expensive than those currently offered by the Company.\\nMost of the  flowers  sold in the United  States  are grown by  farmers  located\\nabroad, primarily in Colombia, Ecuador and Holland, and the Company expects that\\nthis will continue in the futureThe availability and price of flowers could be\\naffected by a number of factors affecting these regions, including:\\n       o  import duties and quotas;\\n       o  agricultural limitations and restrictions to manage pests and disease;\\n       o  changes in trading

Legal,  Executive and Customer Service\\n     Center functions, as well as Stock-Based CompensationIn order to leverage\\n     the  Company\\'s  infrastructure,   these  functions  are  operated

than  those of the\\n     Customer  Service  Center,  which  are  allocated  directly  to  the  above\\n     categories based upon usage, are included within corporate expenses as they\\n     are not directly allocable to a specific category.\\n(**) Performance is measured based on category  contribution  margin or category\\n     EBITDA,  reflecting  only the direct  controllable  revenue  and  operating\\n     expenses of the categories As such, management\\'s measure of profitability\\n     for these  categories  does not include the effect of  corporate  overhead,\\n     described above, nor does it include  depreciation and amortization,  other\\n     income (net), and income taxesManagement utilizes EBITDA as a performance\\n     measurement  tool  because  it  considers  such  information  a  meaningful\\n     supplemental  measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used\\n     by the investment  community in the evaluation of companies with comparable\\n     market  capitalization The Company also uses EBITDA as one of the factors\\n     used to determine  the total  amount of bonuses  available to be awarded to\\n     executive officers and other employeesThe Company\\'s credit agreement uses\\n     EBITDA (with additional  adjustments) to measure  compliance with covenants\\n     such as interest  coverage and debt incurrence EBITDA is also used by the\\n     Company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates EBITDA has\\n     limitations  as an  analytical  tool,  and  should  not  be  considered  in\\n     isolation  or as a  substitute  for  analysis of the  Company\\'s  results as\\n     reported  under GAAP Some of these  limitations  are: (a) EBITDA does not\\n     reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company\\'s working capital\\n     needs; (b) EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the\\n     cash requirements  necessary to service interest or principal payments,  on\\n     the Company\\'s  debts;  and (c) although  depreciation  and amortization are\\n     non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be\\n     replaced in the future,  and EBITDA does not reflect any cash  requirements\\n     for such capital expenditures Because of these limitations, EBITDA should\\n     only be used on a  supplemental  basis  combined  with  GAAP  results  when\\n     evaluating the Company\\'s performance.\\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA:\\nResults of Operations\\nThe  Company\\'s  fiscal  year is a 52- or  53-week  period  ending on

growth of 0.7% during the fiscal year ended June 29, 2008\\nwas primarily  attributable to the continued expansion of the Company\\'s BloomNet\\nWire Service business, which increased 20.5% over the prior fiscal year, as well\\nas growth from the Gourmet Food & Gift Basket  business,  which  increased  1.9%\\nover the same  period of the prior  year,  partially  offset by a decline in the\\nHome and  Children\\'s  Gifts  business  as a  result  of the  discontinuation  of\\nnon-performing  catalog titles in order to improve the overall operating results\\nwithin this category During this challenging consumer  environment,  which was\\ncharacterized by cautious consumer spending and aggressive  promotional activity\\nby competitors across the gifting industry, the Company made the decision not to\\nchase revenue growth in its direct-to-consumer  businesses,  instead focusing on\\nachieving  its  primary  goal of  leveraging  its  business  platform  to  drive\\nprofitable

revenue growth of 16.7% during the fiscal year ended July 1, 2007\\nwas due to a  combination  of organic  growth,  as well as the  acquisitions  of\\nFannie May Confections Brands, a manufacturer and

discussion and analysis of its financial  position and results of\\noperations   are  based   upon  the   consolidated   financial   statements   of\\n1-800-FLOWERS.COM,  Inc.,  which  have been  prepared  in  accordance  with U.S.\\ngenerally  accepted  accounting  principles The preparation of these financial\\nstatements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\\nreported  amount of assets,  liabilities,  revenue  and  expenses,  and  related\\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilitiesOn an ongoing basis, management\\nevaluates  its  estimates,  including  those  related  to  revenue  recognition,\\ninventory and long-lived assets,  including goodwill and other intangible assets\\nrelated  to  acquisitions Management  bases its  estimates  and  judgments  on\\nhistorical  experience  and on various  other  factors  that are  believed to be\\nreasonable  under the  circumstances,  the  results  of which form the basis for\\nmaking  judgments  about the carrying values of assets and  liabilities Actual\\nresults  may  differ  from  these  estimates  under  different   assumptions  or\\nconditions Management  believes the following  critical  accounting  policies,\\namong  others,  affect its more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used in\\npreparation of its consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet revenues are generated by E-commerce  operations  from the Company\\'s  online\\nand telephonic sales channels as well as other operations (retail/wholesale) and\\nprimarily  consist of the  selling  price of  merchandise,  service or  outbound\\nshipping  charges,  less  discounts,  returns  and  credits Net  revenues  are\\nrecognized upon product  shipment Shipping terms are FOB shipping  point Net\\nrevenues  generated by the Company\\'s  BloomNet Wire Service  operations  include\\nmembership  fees as well as other  products  and service  offerings to florists.\\nMembership fees are recognized  monthly in the period earned, and products sales\\nare recognized upon product shipment with shipping terms of FOB shipping point.\\nAccounts Receivable\\nThe Company  maintains  allowances  for doubtful  accounts for estimated  losses\\nresulting  from the inability of its customers or  franchisees  to make required\\n                                       38\\npayments If the financial  condition of the Company\\'s customers or franchisees\\nwere to  deteriorate,  resulting  in an  impairment  of  their  ability  to make\\npayments, additional allowances may be required.\\nThe Company  states  inventory at the lower of cost or market In assessing the\\nrealization  of  inventories,  we are  required to make  judgments  as to future\\ndemand  requirements and compare that with inventory levelsIt is possible that\\nchanges in consumer  demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable  value\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the\\nnet assets  acquired  and is  evaluated  annually  for  impairment The cost of\\nintangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of\\neconomic benefits consumed, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated periods\\nbenefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years.\\nThe Company performs an annual impairment test as of the first day of its fiscal\\nfourth  quarter,  or earlier if indicators  of potential  impairment  exist,  to\\nevaluate goodwillGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the\\nreporting unit exceeds its estimated fair valueIn assessing the recoverability\\nof  goodwill,  the Company  reviews  both  quantitative  as well as  qualitative\\nfactors to support its assumptions with regard to fair valueJudgment regarding\\nthe  existence  of  impairment  indicators  is based on  market  conditions  and\\noperational performance of the CompanyFuture events could cause the Company to\\nconclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible\\nassets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.\\nCapitalized Software\\nThe carrying  value of  capitalized  software,  both  purchased  and  internally\\ndeveloped, is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators Future\\nevents could cause the Company to conclude that impairment  indicators exist and\\nthat capitalized software is impaired.\\nStock-based Compensation\\nSFAS No123R requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based\\non the fair value of the award on the date of grantThe Company  determines the\\nfair value of stock  options  issued by using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing\\nmodelThe Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model considers a range of assumptions\\nrelated to  volatility,  dividend  yield,  risk-free  interest rate and employee\\nexercise behavior Expected  volatilities are based on historical volatility of\\nthe Company\\'s stock priceThe dividend yield is based on historical  experience\\nand future  expectations The  risk-free  interest  rate is derived from the US\\nTreasury  yield curve in effect at the time of grant The  Black-Scholes  model\\nalso  incorporates  expected  forfeiture  rates,  based on historical  behavior.\\nDetermining  these  assumptions  are  subjective and complex,  and therefore,  a\\nchange in the  assumptions  utilized  could impact the  calculation  of the fair\\nvalue of the Company\\'s stock options.\\nThe Company  has  established  deferred  income tax assets and  liabilities  for\\ntemporary  differences  between the financial reporting bases and the income tax\\nbases of its  assets and  liabilities  at enacted  tax rates  expected  to be in\\neffect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled The Company has\\nrecognized  as a deferred  tax asset the tax  benefits  associated  with  losses\\nrelated to  operations,  which are  expected to result in a future tax  benefit.\\nRealization  of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate\\nsufficient  future  taxable  income so that these assets will be  realized The\\nfactors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization  include the\\nforecast of future  taxable  income and available tax planning  strategies  that\\ncould be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.\\nIt is the  Company\\'s  policy to provide  for  uncertain  tax  positions  and the\\nrelated interest and penalties based upon  management\\'s  assessment of whether a\\ntax benefit is  more-likely-than-not to  be sustained upon examination by taxing\\nauthorities To the  extent  that the  Company  prevails  in matter for which a\\nliability for an  unrecognized  tax benefit is established or is required to pay\\namounts in the excess of the  liability,  the Company\\'s  effective tax rate in a\\ngiven financial statement period may be affected.\\n                                       39\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No162,

and\\nassumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements  and\\naccompanying notesActual results could differ from those estimates.\\nCash and Equivalents\\nCash and

annual  impairment test as of\\nthe  first day of its  fiscal  fourth  quarter,  or  earlier  if  indicators  of\\npotential  impairment  exist,  to  evaluate  goodwill Goodwill  is  considered\\nimpaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair\\nvalue In assessing the  recoverability  of goodwill,  the Company reviews both\\nquantitative  as well as  qualitative  factors to support its  assumptions  with\\nregard to fair valueTo date, there has been no impairment of these assets.\\nThe cost of intangible  assets with  determinable  lives is amortized to reflect\\nthe pattern of economic benefits  consumed,  on a straight-line  basis, over the\\nestimated periods benefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years.\\nDeferred Catalog Costs\\nThe Company  capitalizes the costs of producing and  distributing  its catalogs.\\nThese  costs are  amortized  in direct  proportion  with  actual  sales from the\\ncorresponding  catalog  over a period

realized  gains  and  losses  on  available-for-sale  securities  is\\ndetermined on a specific identification basis.\\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\\nThe  recorded  amounts  of  the  Company\\'s  cash  and  equivalents,   short-term\\ninvestments,  receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate\\ntheir fair values  principally  because of the short-term nature of these items.\\nThe fair value of investments, including available-for-sale securities, is based\\non  quoted  market  prices  where  available The fair  value of the  Company\\'s\\nlong-term  obligations,  the majority of which are carried at a variable rate of\\ninterest,  are  estimated  based on the current rates offered to the Company for\\nobligations of similar terms and  maturities Under this method,  the Company\\'s\\nfair value of long-term  obligations  was not  significantly  different than the\\ncarrying values at June 29, 2008 and July 1, 2007.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nFinancial  instruments  that  potentially  subject  the  Company to  significant\\nconcentrations  of credit  risk  consist  principally  of cash and  equivalents,\\ninvestments and accounts receivable The Company maintains cash and equivalents\\nand investments with high credit, quality financial institutions Concentration\\nof credit  risk with  respect to  accounts  receivable  are

and\\nChief  Executive  Officer,  acquired a single  retail  florist in New York City,\\nwhich he  subsequently  expanded to a 14-store  chain Thereafter,  the Company\\nmodified  its  business  strategy to take  advantage  of the rapid  emergence of\\ntoll-free callingThe Company acquired the right to use the toll-free telephone\\nnumber  1-800-FLOWERS,  adopted  it as  its  corporate  identity  and  began  to\\naggressively  build a national brand around itThe Company  believes it was one\\nof the first companies to embrace this new way of conducting business.\\nIn order to support the growth of its toll-free business and to provide superior\\ncustomer  service,  the  Company  developed  an  operating  infrastructure  that\\nincorporated the best available technologiesOver time, the Company implemented\\na sophisticated transaction processing system that facilitated rapid order entry\\nand fulfillment,  an advanced  telecommunications  system and multiple  customer\\nservice centers to handle increasing call volume.\\nTo enable the Company to deliver products  reliably  nationwide on a same-day or\\nnext-day basis and to market  pre-selected,  high-quality  floral products,  the\\nCompany created  BloomNet(R),  a nationwide network including  independent local\\nflorists selected for their high-quality products, superior customer service and\\norder fulfillment and delivery capabilities.\\nThe Company\\'s  online  presence has enabled it to expand the number and types of\\nproducts it can effectively offer to its customersAs a result, the Company

giftware and gourmet gift\\nbasketsThe Company has also significantly expanded its presence in the gourmet\\nfood and gift baskets category through a combination of organic  initiatives and\\nstrategic  acquisitions  beginning with the purchase of  GreatFood.com,  Incin\\n                                       1\\nNovember  1999,  followed  by the  purchase  of  certain  assets of

network of home agents to provide\\n          helpful  assistance on everything from advice on product  selection to\\n          the monitoring of the fulfillment and delivery process.\\nAs a result of the  dramatic  decline in the consumer  economy,  the Company has\\nintensified  its focus on the three  principals that it believes will enable the\\nCompany to drive long-term profitable

the variety of delivery and shipping  options (same day/next day)\\nand 24 hour/7 day customer service that are available to all its customers:\\nTechnology Infrastructure\\nThe Company  believes it has been and  continues to be a leader in  implementing\\nnew  technologies  and systems to give its customers the best possible  shopping\\nexperience,  whether online or over the telephoneThrough the use of customized\\nsoftware  applications,  the  Company  is able to  retrieve,  sort  and  analyze\\ncustomer  information  to enable it to better serve its customers and target its\\nproduct  offerings The Company\\'s online and telephonic orders are fed directly\\nfrom the Company\\'s  secure web sites,  or with the assistance of a gift advisor,\\ninto a transaction  processing  system which captures the required  customer and\\nrecipient  information The system  then  routes  the order to the  appropriate\\nCompany  warehouse,  or for florist fulfilled or drop-shipped  items,  selects a\\n                                       5\\nvendor  to  fulfill  the  customer\\'s  order  and  electronically  transmits  the\\nnecessary   information   using   BloomLink(R),    the   Company\\'s   proprietary\\ncommunication system,  assuring timely deliveryIn addition, the Company\\'s gift\\nadvisors have electronic access to this system, enabling them to assist in order\\nfulfillment and subsequently track other customer and/or order information.\\nThe Company\\'s technology  infrastructure,  primarily consisting of the Company\\'s\\nweb sites,  transaction  processing,  manufacturing  and  warehouse  management,\\ncustomer databases and  telecommunications  systems, is built and maintained for\\nreliability,  security,  scalability  and  flexibility To minimize the risk of\\nservice interruptions from unexpected component or  telecommunications  failure,\\nmaintenance  and  upgrades,  the  Company  has built  full  back-up  and  system\\nredundancies  into those  components of its systems that have been identified as\\nFulfillment and Manufacturing Operations\\nThe Company\\'s  customers  primarily place their orders either online or over the\\ntelephone The  Company\\'s  development  of a hybrid  fulfillment  system  which\\nenables the Company to offer same-day,  next-day and any-day delivery,  combines\\nthe use of BloomNet  (comprised of independent  florists operating retail flower\\nshops and LFC\\'s,  Company-owned  stores,  LFC\\'s, and franchise stores), with the\\nCompany-owned  distribution  centers and brand-name vendors who ship directly to\\nthe Company\\'s customers While providing a significant competitive advantage in\\nterms of delivery options,  the Company\\'s  fulfillment system also has the added\\nbenefit  of  reducing  the  Company\\'s  capital   investments  in  inventory  and\\ninfrastructure All of the Company\\'s products are backed by a 100% satisfaction\\nguarantee, and the Company\\'s business is not dependent on any single third-party\\nTo ensure reliable and efficient  communication of online and telephonic  orders\\nto its  BloomNet  members and third party gift  vendors,  the Company  developed\\nBloomLink(R),  a proprietary  and secure  internet-based  communications  system\\nwhich is available to all BloomNet  members and  third-party  gift vendors The\\nCompany  also has the  ability to arrange for  international  delivery of floral\\nproducts through independent wire services and direct relationships.\\nFulfillment and manufacturing of products is as follows:\\nFlowers and Plants A majority of the Company\\'s  floral orders are fulfilled by\\none of the  Company\\'s  BloomNet  members,  allowing  the  Company to deliver its\\nfloral products on a same-day or next-day basis to ensure  freshness and to meet\\nits customers\\' need for immediate  gifting In addition,  the Company is better\\npositioned to ensure  consistent  product quality and  presentation  and offer a\\ngreater  variety of  arrangements,  which  creates a better  experience  for its\\ncustomers and gift recipients The Company selects retail florists for BloomNet\\nbased upon the florist\\'s design staff, facilities, quality of floral processing,\\nand delivery  capabilities and allocates orders to members within a geographical\\narea based on historical  performance of the florist in fulfilling  orders,  and\\nthe  number  of  BloomNet  florists  currently  serving  the area The  Company\\nregularly monitors BloomNet florists\\' performance and adherence to the Company\\'s\\nquality standards to ensure proper fulfillment.\\nThe Company\\'s  relationships with its BloomNet members are  non-exclusive Many\\nflorists,  including  many BloomNet  florists,  also are members of other floral\\nfulfillment  organizations The BloomNet agreements generally are cancelable by\\neither party with ten days notification and do not guarantee any orders,  dollar\\namounts or exclusive  territories  from the Company to the  florist In certain\\ninstances,  the  Company is  required  to fulfill  orders  through  non-BloomNet\\nmembers,  and  transmits  these  orders  to the  fulfilling  florist  using  the\\ncommunication system of an independent wire service or via telephone.\\nIn addition to its florist designed product, the Company offers its customers an\\nalternative to florist  designed  products through its Fresh From Our Growers(R)\\nprogram,  and by providing  for a full array of products from bouquets to unique\\nfloral  arrangements  designed by in-house  expert Julie McCann Mulligan or from\\nits exclusive Martha Stewart for 1-800-FLOWERS.COM(TM) collection.\\nAs of June 28, 2009, the Company  operates 2 floral retail stores located in New\\nYork and 1  fulfillment  center In  addition,  the Company has 104  franchised\\nstores, located primarily in California, Colorado, Florida, New Jersey, New York\\nand Texas Company-owned stores serve as local points of fulfillment and enable\\nthe Company to test new products and marketing programs.\\nGourmet Foods and Gift Baskets In order to take advantage of improved margins,\\nbetter control  quality and to offer premium branded  signature  products in the\\nGourmet Food and Gift Baskets product category, the Company has acquired several\\ngourmet food  retailers with  manufacturing  operations The Company\\'s  premium\\nchocolates  are  manufactured  and  distributed  from its  200,000  square  foot\\n                                       6\\nproduction facility in Akron, Ohio, and the Company\\'s cookie and baked gifts are\\nfulfilled from its 176,000 square foot baking and distribution  center in Obetz,\\nOhio,  while its premium popcorn and related snack products are shipped from the\\nCompany\\'s 148,000 square foot  manufacturing and distribution  center located in\\nLake Forest,  Illinois The Company\\'s

Melrose Park, IL.\\nThe Company\\'s quarterly results may experience seasonal fluctuationsDue to the\\nCompany\\'s expansion into non-floral products, the Thanksgiving through Christmas\\nholiday  season,  which  falls  within  the  Company\\'s  second  fiscal  quarter,\\ngenerates the highest proportion of the Company\\'s annual revenues In addition,\\nas the result of a number of major floral gifting occasions,  including Mother\\'s\\nDay and  Administrative  Professionals  Week,  revenues  also  rise  during  the\\nCompany\\'s  fiscal fourth quarter Finally,  results during the Company\\'s fiscal\\nfirst quarter are negatively impacted by the lack of major gift-giving holidays,\\nand the disproportionate amount of overhead incurred during this slow period.\\nThe  Company\\'s  fiscal  second  quarter,  its largest in terms of  revenues,  is\\nexpected to account for  approximately  34-36% of sales,  followed by its fiscal\\nfourth quarter,  which is expected to account for 25-27% of salesThe Company\\'s\\nfiscal third quarter is expected to account for  approximately  23-25% of sales,\\nwhile  the   Company\\'s   fiscal  first   quarter  is  expected  to  account  for\\napproximately 15-17% of sales.\\nAccordingly,  a disproportionate amount of operating cash flows are generated in\\nthe  Company\\'s  fiscal  second  and  fourth  quarters In  preparation  for the\\nCompany\\'s second quarter holiday season, the Company significantly increases its\\ninventories, and therefore, corresponding cash requirements, which traditionally\\nhave been financed by cash flows from  operations and bank lines of credit,  are\\nhighest during the latter part of the Company\\'s  fiscal first  quarter,  peaking\\nwithin its second  fiscal  quarter The  Company  has  historically  repaid all\\nrevolving bank lines of credit with cash generated from operations, prior to the\\nend of the Company\\'s fiscal second quarter.\\nThe growing  popularity and convenience of e-commerce has continued to give rise\\nto established businesses on the InternetIn addition to selling their products\\nover the  Internet,  many of these  retailers  sell  their  products  through  a\\ncombination of channels by maintaining a web site, a toll-free  phone number and\\nphysical locations Additionally, several of these merchants offer an expanding\\nvariety of products and some are  attracting an increasing  number of customers.\\nCertain mass  merchants  have  expanded  their  offerings  to include  competing\\nproducts and may continue to do so in the futureThese mass merchants,  as well\\nas other potential competitors, may be able to:\\n     o    undertake  more  extensive  marketing  campaigns  for their brands and\\n          services;\\n     o    adopt more aggressive pricing policies; and\\n     o    make more attractive offers to potential  employees,  distributors and\\n          retailers.\\nIn addition,  the Company faces intense  competition  in each of its  individual\\nproduct  categories In the floral  industry,  there are various  providers  of\\nfloral  products,  none of which is  dominant  in the  industry The  Company\\'s\\ncompetitors include:\\n     o    retail  floral  shops,  some of  which  maintain  toll-free  telephone\\n          numbers and web sites;\\n     o    online floral retailers;\\n     o    catalog companies that offer floral products;\\n     o    floral telemarketers and wire services; and\\n     o    supermarkets,  mass  merchants  and  specialty  retailers  with floral\\n          departments.\\nSimilarly,  the plant, gift basket, gourmet foods and wine categories are highly\\ncompetitive Each of these categories  encompasses a wide range of products, is\\nhighly fragmented and is served by a large number of companies, none of which is\\ndominant Products  in these  categories  may be  purchased  from a  number  of\\noutlets, including mass merchants, telemarketers, retail specialty shops, online\\nretailers and mail-order catalogs.\\n                                       7\\nThe Company  believes the strength of its brands,  product  selection,  customer\\nrelationships,  technology  infrastructure and fulfillment capabilities position\\nit to compete effectively against its current and potential  competitors in each\\nof its product categoriesHowever, increased competition could result in:\\n     o    price reductions, decreased revenues and lower profit margins;\\n     o    loss of market share; and\\n     o    increased marketing expenditures.\\nThese and other competitive  factors may adversely impact the Company\\'s business\\nand results of operations.\\nGovernment Regulation and Legal Uncertainties\\nThe  Internet  continues to evolve and there are laws and  regulations  directly\\napplicable to e-commerceLegislatures are also considering an increasing number\\nof  laws  and  regulations  pertaining  to  the  Internet,  including  laws  and\\nregulations addressing:\\n     o    user privacy;\\n     o    connectivity;\\n     o    intellectual property;\\n     o    distribution;\\n     o    taxation;\\n     o    liabilities;\\n     o    antitrust; and\\n     o    characteristics and quality of products and services.\\nFurther, the growth and development of the market for online services may prompt\\nmore stringent  consumer  protection laws that may impose additional  burdens on\\nthose companies  conducting business onlineThe adoption of any additional laws\\nor  regulations  may impair  the growth of the  Internet  or  commercial  online\\nservicesThis could decrease the demand for the Company\\'s services and increase\\nits cost of doing  business Moreover,  the  applicability  to the  Internet of\\nexisting  laws  regarding  issues  like  property  ownership,  taxes,  libel and\\npersonal  privacy is uncertain Any new  legislation or regulation  that has an\\nadverse  impact  on the  Internet  or  the  application  of  existing  laws  and\\nregulations  to  the  Internet  could  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the\\nCompany\\'s business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nStates or foreign countries might attempt to regulate the Company\\'s  business or\\nlevy  additional  sales or other taxes relating to its  activities Because the\\nCompany\\'s  products and services are available over the Internet anywhere in the\\nworld,  multiple  jurisdictions  may claim that the  Company is  required  to do\\nbusiness as a foreign corporation in one or more of those jurisdictionsFailure\\nto qualify  as a foreign  corporation  in a  jurisdiction  where the  Company is\\nrequired  to do so could  subject it to taxes and

UPS or FedEx were\\nto terminate delivery services for alcoholic  beverages in certain states, as it\\ndid in 1999 in Florida,  Nevada and Connecticut,  the Company would likely incur\\nsignificantly higher shipping rates that would have a material adverse effect on\\nthe Company\\'s business and its results of operations If any state prohibits or\\nlimits intrastate shipping of alcoholic  beverages by third party couriers,  the\\nCompany would likely incur significantly higher shipping rates that would have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\\'s business and its results of

research  studies  suggest that health benefits may result\\nfrom the  moderate  consumption  of wine,  these  suggestions  have been  widely\\nchallenged  and a number of groups  advocate  increased  governmental  action to\\nrestrict  consumption  of  alcoholic  beverages Restrictions  on the  sale and\\nconsumption  of wine or  increases  in the taxes  imposed on wine in response to\\nconcerns  regarding  health  issues  may have a material  adverse  effect on the\\nCompany\\'s business and operating  results There can be no assurance that there\\nwill not be legal or regulatory  challenges to the industry as a whole,  and any\\nsuch legal or  regulatory  challenge may have a material  adverse  effect on the\\nCompany\\'s business and results of operations.\\nThe price at which the

respectively The decrease in the  effective\\ntax rate  during the fiscal  year ended June 29, 2008  resulted  primarily  from\\nlower  state  taxes,  as well as various  tax credits  programs The  Company\\'s\\neffective  tax rate for the fiscal  years  ended June 29,  2008 and July 1, 2007\\ndiffered  from the U.S federal  statutory  rate of 35%  primarily due to state\\nincome taxes,

20.2% and 3.6%,  respectively,  over the\\nprior  year  periods  primarily  as a result  of  lower  order  volume  from the\\nE-commerce  sales channel,  due to a combination of reduced  consumer  spending,\\nparticularly  in the home decor  product  category,  and a planned  reduction in\\ncatalog circulation,  including the elimination of the Madison Place and Problem\\nSolvers  catalog  titles in fiscal  2008 Further  contributing  to the revenue\\ndecline were lower retail store sales, compared to the same periods of the prior\\nyear, due to a decline in customer traffic.\\nGross profit from discontinued operations during the fiscal years ended June 28,\\n2009 and June 29,  2008,  decreased  by 17.2% and 5.2%,  respectively,  over the\\nprior year periods as a result of the  aforementioned  revenue  declines Gross\\nmargin  percentage  during  fiscal  2009  increased  170 basis  points to 46.9%,\\nbenefiting from enhanced product sourcing and shipping initiatives, while during\\nfiscal 2008, the gross margin percentage  declined 70 basis points to 45.2%, due\\nto  promotional  offers  designed to re-engage  core  customers who had left the\\nbrand  during  fiscal  2007  when it had  unsuccessfully  moved  away  from  its\\ntraditional  product  offerings,  as well as from higher fuel  surcharges on its\\noutbound shipments.\\nOperating  income  (loss) from  discontinued  operations  during the fiscal year\\nended June 28, 2009 includes  approximately $0.4 million of restructuring  costs\\nassociated with the Company\\'s cost reduction initiatives.\\nDuring fiscal 2009, the Home and Children\\'s Gift segment experienced significant\\ndeclines in revenue and operating  performance  when compared to prior years and\\ntheir strategic  outlook The Company  believes that this weak  performance was\\nattributable  to reduced  consumer  spending due to the overall  weakness in the\\neconomy,  and in particular,  as a result of the continued decline in demand for\\nhome decor  products As a result of these  factors,  as well as the  Company\\'s\\nplans to resize this category based on the expectation of continued  weakness in\\nthe home decor  retail  sector,  upon  completion  of the  Company\\'s  impairment\\nanalysis,  the  goodwill and  intangibles  related to this  reporting  unit were\\ndeemed to be fully

with U.S.\\ngenerally  accepted  accounting  principles The preparation of these financial\\nstatements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\\nreported  amount of assets,  liabilities,  revenue  and  expenses,  and  related\\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilitiesOn an ongoing basis, management\\nevaluates  its  estimates,  including  those  related  to  revenue  recognition,\\ninventory and long-lived assets,  including goodwill and other intangible assets\\nrelated  to  acquisitions Management  bases its  estimates  and  judgments  on\\nhistorical  experience  and on various  other  factors  that are  believed to be\\nreasonable  under the  circumstances,  the  results  of which form the basis for\\nmaking  judgments  about the carrying values of assets and  liabilities Actual\\nresults  may  differ  from  these  estimates  under  different   assumptions  or\\nconditions Management  believes the following  critical  accounting  policies,\\namong  others,  affect its more  significant  judgments  and  estimates  used in\\npreparation of its consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet revenues are generated by E-commerce  operations  from the Company\\'s  online\\nand telephonic sales channels as well as other operations (retail/wholesale) and\\nprimarily  consist of the  selling  price of

financial  condition of the Company\\'s customers or franchisees\\nwere to  deteriorate,  resulting  in an  impairment  of  their  ability  to make\\npayments, additional allowances may be required.\\nThe Company  states  inventory at the lower of cost or market In assessing the\\nrealization  of  inventories,  we are  required to make  judgments  as to future\\ndemand  requirements and compare that with inventory levelsIt is possible that\\nchanges in consumer  demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable  value\\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\\nGoodwill  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the\\nnet assets  acquired  and is  evaluated  annually  for  impairment The cost of\\nintangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of\\neconomic benefits consumed, on a straight-line basis, over the estimated periods\\nbenefited, ranging from 3 to 16 years.\\nThe Company performs an annual impairment test as of the first day of its fiscal\\nfourth  quarter,  or earlier if indicators  of potential  impairment  exist,  to\\nevaluate goodwillGoodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the\\nreporting unit exceeds its estimated fair valueIn assessing the recoverability\\nof  goodwill,  the Company  reviews  both  quantitative  as well as  qualitative\\nfactors to support its assumptions with regard to fair valueJudgment regarding\\nthe  existence  of  impairment  indicators  is based on  market  conditions  and\\noperational performance of the CompanyFuture events could cause the Company to\\nconclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible\\nassets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired.\\nCapitalized Software\\nThe carrying  value of  capitalized  software,  both  purchased  and  internally\\ndeveloped, is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators Future\\nevents could cause the Company to conclude that impairment  indicators exist and\\nthat capitalized software is impaired.\\nStock-based Compensation\\nSFAS No123R requires the measurement of stock-based compensation expense based\\non the fair value of the award on the date of grantThe Company  determines the\\nfair value of stock  options  issued by using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricing\\nmodelThe Black-Scholes  option-pricing  model considers a range of assumptions\\nrelated to  volatility,  dividend  yield,  risk-free  interest rate and employee\\nexercise behavior Expected  volatilities are based on historical volatility of\\nthe Company\\'s stock priceThe dividend yield is based on historical  experience\\nand future  expectations The  risk-free  interest  rate is derived from the US\\nTreasury  yield curve in effect at the time of grant The  Black-Scholes  model\\nalso  incorporates  expected  forfeiture  rates,  based on historical  behavior.\\nDetermining  these  assumptions  are  subjective and complex,  and therefore,  a\\nchange in the  assumptions  utilized  could impact the  calculation  of the fair\\nvalue of the Company\\'s stock options.\\nThe Company  has  established  deferred  income tax assets and  liabilities  for\\ntemporary  differences  between the financial reporting bases and the income tax\\nbases of its  assets and  liabilities  at enacted  tax rates  expected  to be in\\neffect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled The Company has\\nrecognized  as a deferred  tax asset the tax  benefits  associated  with  losses\\nrelated to  operations,  which are  expected to result in a future tax  benefit.\\nRealization  of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate\\nsufficient  future  taxable  income so that these assets will be  realized The\\nfactors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization  include the\\nforecast of future  taxable  income and available tax planning  strategies  that\\ncould be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets.\\nIt is the  Company\\'s  policy to provide  for  uncertain  tax  positions  and the\\nrelated interest and penalties based upon  management\\'s  assessment of whether a\\n                                       40\\ntax benefit is  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained upon examination by taxing\\nauthorities To the extent  that the  Company  prevails  in matters for which a\\nliability for an  unrecognized  tax benefit is established or is required to pay\\namounts in excess of the liability,  the Company\\'s effective tax rate in a given\\nfinancial statement period may be affected.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn June 2009,  the FASB  issued  SFAS No168,  \"The FASB  Accounting  Standards\\nCodification and the

Board\\nInterpretation  No 48,  \"Accounting  for  Uncertainty  in  Income  Taxes  - an\\ninterpretation  of FASB  Statement  No109\" (\"FIN  48\") FIN 48  prescribes  a\\nrecognition  and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a\\ntax  return For  those  benefits  to be  recognized,  a tax  position  must be\\nmore-likely-than-not  to be sustained upon  examination  by

for\\neach of the periods presented.\\nFair Value Measurements\\nEffective June 30, 2008, the Company adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting\\nStandard No157, \"Fair Value  Measurements\"  (\"SFAS 157\") for certain financial\\nassets and liabilitiesThis standard establishes a framework for measuring fair\\nvalue and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements SFAS 157\\nclarifies that fair value is an exit price,  representing  the amount that would\\nbe  received  to sell an asset or paid to  transfer  a  liability  in an orderly\\ntransaction between market participants SFAS 157 also establishes a fair value\\nhierarchy that  prioritizes  the inputs to valuation  techniques used to measure\\nfair valueThe statement  requires that assets and liabilities  carried at fair\\nvalue be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\\n                                      F-9\\n                    1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Incand

prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities,\\n         quoted prices for identically similar assets or liabilities in markets\\n         that are not active and models for which all significant inputs are\\n         observable either directly or indirectly.\\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity\\'s own assumptions\\n         or external inputs for inactive markets.\\nThe  determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is\\nbased  upon the  lowest  level of input  that is  significant  to the fair value\\nmeasurement While the Company has  previously  invested in certain assets that\\nwould be classified as \"level 1\", as of June 28, 2009, the Company does not hold\\nany \"level 1\" cash  equivalents  that are  measured at fair value on a recurring\\nbasis,  nor does the Company  have any assets or  liabilities  that are based on\\n\"level 2\" or \"level 3\" inputs.\\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\\nBasic net income (loss) per common share is computed using the  weighted-average\\nnumber of common shares  outstanding  during the period Diluted net income per\\nshare is  computed  using the  weighted-average  number of common  and  dilutive\\ncommon  equivalent  shares  (consisting  primarily of employee stock options and\\nunvested  restricted stock awards)  outstanding  during the period Diluted net\\nloss per share is computed  using the  weighted-average  number of common shares\\noutstanding  during the period,  and excludes  the effect of dilutive  potential\\ncommon  shares  (consisting  primarily  of employee  stock  options and unvested\\nrestricted stock awards) as their inclusion would be antidilutive.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn June 2009,  the
