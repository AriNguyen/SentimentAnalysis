company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to\\nlocate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses and rural and off-highway\\nlocations. we are continuing the expansion of our stores, particularly drive-thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative\\nstore formats, which are designed to provide a more streamlined customer experience in dense metropolitan areas.\\nprior to the novel coronavirus outbreak, known as the global pandemic covid-19, approximately 80% of starbucks transactions in u.s. company-operated stores\\nwere “on-the-go” occasions. this has prompted us to reexamine our u.s. store footprint and evolve our retail presence over time through targeted store\\nrenovations, relocations and new stores. we have since introduced a new store format, starbucks  pickup, to enhance the “on-the-go” customer experience and\\nimprove operating efficiency across starbucks stores in certain major metropolitan areas in the americas. new store formats, such as starbucks pickup, are\\nsuitable for customers who prefer to order ahead and pay through the starbucks  mobile app for pick-up. in our major international markets, we continue to invest\\nin technology and establish partnerships with third parties with relevant expertise to increase digital adoption to provide convenience and elevate the customer\\nexperience. in china, the introduction of starbucks now  stores enables a seamless integration of physical and digital customer touchpoints. orders may be\\nplaced in advance through the starbucks mobile app or starbucks delivers\\nretail format locations. these strategies align closely with rapidly evolving customer preferences, including higher levels of mobile ordering, more contactless\\npick-up experiences and reduced in-store congestion, all of which naturally allow for greater physical distancing. we believe our continued efforts to transform our\\nstore portfolio and elevate technology will enhance the customer experience and position starbucks for long-term growth.\\n\\n and can be conveniently picked up by customers and delivery riders in these express\\n\\ntm\\n\\ntm\\n\\n®

significant accounting policies,\\nincluded in item 8 of part ii of this 10-k, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program.\\nlicensed stores\\nrevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 10% of total net revenues in fiscal 2020. licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher\\noperating margin than company-operated stores. under the licensed model, starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store\\noperator along with a royalty on retail sales. licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments which more than offset the lower revenues we\\nreceive under the licensed store model.\\nin our licensed store operations, we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. licensees provide\\nimproved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. as part of\\nthese arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. we\\nalso sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. employees working in licensed retail\\nlocations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores.\\nin a limited number of international markets, we also use

supply\\nstarbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. to ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we control\\nsubstantially all coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. we purchase green coffee beans from\\nmultiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees.\\nthe price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by\\nstarbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c” coffee commodity price. both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the\\nsupply and demand at the time of purchase. supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters,\\ncrop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. price is also impacted by trading\\nactivities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. in addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past,\\nand may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee\\nthrough agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies.\\nwe buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green\\ncoffee. we also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge \"c\" price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-\\nterm forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. total purchase commitments, together with\\nexisting inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2022.\\nwe depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. we believe, based on\\nrelationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote.\\nto help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, starbucks operates nine farmer support\\ncenters, including our china farmer support center located in the yunnan province of\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\n®\\n\\nthis high-growth market. all farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote\\nbest practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate and other impacts.\\nin addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. we\\nbelieve, based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote.\\nproducts other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in starbucks  stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased\\nfrom several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased\\nfrom national, regional and local sources. we also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to\\nsupport the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. we believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers\\nand manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote.\\ncompetition\\nour primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops. we believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on\\nthe basis of product quality, service and convenience, as well as price. we continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service\\nrestaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. we also\\ncompete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores.\\nour coffee and tea products sold through our channel development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores,\\nwarehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market.\\ntrademarks, copyrights, patents and domain names\\nstarbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the u.s. and in other countries throughout the world. some of our\\ntrademarks, including starbucks, the starbucks logo, starbucks reserve, seattle’s best coffee, teavana and frappuccino are of material importance. the duration\\nof trademark registrations varies from country to country. however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use\\nand/or their registrations are properly maintained.\\nwe own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. we also hold patents on certain\\nproducts, systems and designs. in addition, starbucks has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names, including “starbucks.com,” “starbucks.net,”\\n“starbucksreserve.com,” “seattlesbest.com” and “teavana.com.”\\nseasonality and quarterly results\\nour business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. however,\\nthe covid-19 outbreak may have an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic that may result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our\\nbusiness. additionally, as starbucks cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations\\nduring the first quarter of the fiscal year. however, since revenues from starbucks cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the\\ncard, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. as a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results\\nfor any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\\ngovernment regulation\\nas a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the united states and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and\\nregulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. compliance with these laws, rules and regulation has not had, and is not expected\\nto have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\nhuman capital management\\nas a company, starbucks mission is not only to deliver outstanding financial results by offering exceptional and unique products and services, but to also create a\\nstrong connection with the communities where we operate. we believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global\\nbrand that leads with purpose. this is largely attributed to our partners (employees) who strive every day to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for our\\ncustomers. therefore, one of our core strategies is to invest in and support our partners to differentiate our brand, products and services in the competitive specialty\\ncoffee market, including the following areas of focus:\\noversight and management\\nwe recognize the diversity of customers, partners and communities, and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad\\nspectrum of backgrounds and cultures. working under these principles, our partner resources organization is tasked with managing employment-related matters,\\nincluding recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management and professional development. our board of directors\\nand board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our inclusion and diversity programs and initiatives. as noted in its charter,\\nour compensation and management development committee is responsible for periodically reviewing starbucks partner resource programs and initiatives,\\nincluding healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and strategies. our audit and compliance\\ncommittee works closely with the risk management committee, led by starbucks cfo and general counsel, to monitor current and emerging labor and human\\ncapital management risks and to mitigate exposure to those risks. furthermore, our nominating and corporate governance committee annually evaluates the\\neffectiveness of our social responsibility policies, goals and programs, which also include partner-related issues. these reports and recommendations to the board\\nand its committees are part of the broader framework that guides how starbucks should attract, retain and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and\\nstrategies.\\nwe regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our retail and non-retail partners on a variety of topics, including but not limited to, confidence in\\ncompany leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and improvements on how we could make our\\ncompany an employer of choice. the results are shared with our partners and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and\\nprioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in partner engagement. our management and cross-functional teams\\nalso work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as partner retention, workplace safety, harassment and bullying, as well as to implement\\nmeasures to mitigate these risks.\\ntotal rewards\\nwe have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages. to foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the\\ninterests of partners with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible non-executive partners under our broad-based stock incentive programs.\\nfurthermore, we offer comprehensive, locally relevant and innovative benefits to all eligible partners. in the u.s, our largest and most mature market, these\\ninclude, among other benefits:\\n\\n• comprehensive health insurance coverage is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week.\\n• 100% tuition coverage is provided to partners who earn a bachelor\\'s degree online at arizona state university through the starbucks college\\n\\nachievement program.\\n\\n• parental leaves are provided to all new parents for birth, adoption or foster placement.\\n• a partner and family sick time program is provided and allows partners to accrue paid sick time based on hours worked and use that time for themselves\\n\\nor family members in need of care.\\n\\n• care@work benefit provides partners with subsidized child, adult or senior care planning services. this benefit includes up to 20 days of subsidized\\n\\nbackup care services through the end of fiscal 2021, in light of the covid-19 pandemic.\\n\\n• we view mental health as a fundamental part of our humanity and implemented a comprehensive suite of related programs and benefits in fiscal 2020.\\n\\nthese include headspace, an online application that enables guided mediation, lyra, which provides mental health coaching, and starbucks mental\\nhealth fundamental training, created in partnership with national council for behavioral health, which offers ongoing training to help partners\\nrecognize and respond to signs of mental health and substance use issues.\\n\\noutside of the u.s., we have provided other innovative benefits to help address market-specific needs, such as providing interest-free loans to our u.k. partners to\\nhelp cover rental deposits, mental health services in canada, and in china, a monthly housing subsidy for full-time starbucks baristas and shift supervisors, as well\\nas comprehensive health insurance coverage for parents of partners.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\nrole-based support\\nto help our partners succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. these include, but are not limited to, safety and\\nsecurity protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies. training provided through our pour over sessions include a\\nwide variety of topics such as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback and effective engagement with customers and communities. to\\nhelp further promote an inclusive culture and to better serve our customers, we encourage u.s.-based partners to enroll in the to be welcoming courses we created\\nin partnership with arizona state university to address different forms of bias and discrimination.\\npay equity\\nto be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our\\ncompensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our partners.\\nwe previously achieved and currently maintain 100 percent pay equity in the u.s. for women and men and people of all races for partners performing similar\\nwork. we have also achieved gender pay equity in china and canada, two of our largest markets outside of the u.s., and we made a commitment to achieve\\ngender pay equity in all company-operated markets.\\nas of september 27, 2020, starbucks employed approximately 349,000 people worldwide. in the u.s., starbucks employed approximately 228,000 people, with\\napproximately 220,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in corporate support, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and\\ndistribution operations. approximately 121,000 employees were employed outside of the u.s., with approximately 118,000 in company-operated stores and the\\nremainder in regional support operations. the number of starbucks partners represented by unions is not significant. we believe our efforts in managing our\\nworkforce have been effective, evidenced by a strong starbucks culture and a good relationship between the

consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k, including the\\nmanagement’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. if\\nany of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we\\nface and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\nany time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock.\\nrisks related to macroeconomic conditions\\n• our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the covid-19 pandemic.\\nin december 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, known as covid-19, was first reported and was subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health\\norganization in march 2020. to date, this outbreak has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world, and as the pandemic continues to spread, particularly in the\\nunited states, businesses as well as federal, state and local governments have implemented significant actions to attempt to mitigate this public health crisis. our\\noperations have been and will continue to be disrupted to varying degrees in many markets (from limited operations including only drive-thru and delivery to full\\nstore closures in some markets). while we cannot predict the duration or scope of the covid-19 pandemic, it has negatively impacted our business and such\\nimpact has been and is expected to continue to be material to our financial results, condition and outlook.\\nthe further spread of covid-19, and the requirements to take action to mitigate the spread of the pandemic, will impact our ability to carry out our business as\\nusual and may materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even in regions where we have reopened stores,\\nour stores may be subject to modified hours and operations and/or reduced customer traffic. moreover, certain of those regions, including parts of china and the\\nunited states, have suffered a covid-19 relapse after reopening. if those regions fail to fully contain covid-19, or if additional regions suffer multiple covid-\\n19 relapses, any of those markets may not recover quickly or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. as a\\nresult, we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory, store and corporate assets— and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets\\nmay become limited— any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results. on march 27, 2020, the u.s. government enacted the\\ncoronavirus aid, relief and economic security act (“cares act”), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to\\nemployees who are unable to work during the covid-19 outbreak and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. based on our evaluation of the\\ncares act, we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. additionally, the canadian\\ngovernment enacted the canada emergency wage subsidy (“cews”) to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. we elected\\nto treat qualified government subsidies from the u.s., canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. there is no guarantee that we\\nwill continue to meet the eligibility requirements to participate in any current or future government relief programs or that the benefits will meaningfully offset the\\nlost revenues and incremental costs incurred. increased volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the covid-19 pandemic could\\nhave a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt\\ncovenants.\\nthe extent to which covid-19 impacts our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are\\nhighly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of covid-19 and the efficacy, scope and duration\\nof actions to limit the spread of covid-19 or treat its impact, among others. while such actions have been relaxed or rolled back in certain markets, the actions\\nhave been reinstated in certain regions that have suffered relapse, and may be reinstated in additional regions as the pandemic continues to evolve. the scope and\\ntiming of any such reinstatements are difficult to predict and may materially affect our future operations.\\n• our financial condition and results of operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of other factors, many of which are also largely\\n\\noutside our control.\\n\\nin addition to the covid-19 pandemic, our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of other factors, many of which are\\nlargely outside our control. any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact our\\nbusiness, financial condition and/or results of operations:\\n\\n• increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets;\\n• adverse outcomes of litigation;\\n• severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly\\n\\naffect our retail business in such markets; and\\n\\n• especially in our large markets, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events (including escalating u.s.-china tensions), war, terrorism (including\\n\\nincidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-american sentiment in certain markets, hostilities and social\\nunrest and other health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores.\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\n• economic conditions in the u.s. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nas a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic\\nconditions. our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch\\nto starbucks or competitors\\' lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in\\nfederal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. due to the covid-19 pandemic, we may experience a reduction and/or increased volatility in\\ndemand for our products, which may be caused by, among other things: store closures or modified operating hours and business model, reduced customer traffic\\ndue to illness, quarantine or government or self-imposed restrictions placed on our stores\\' operations and changes in consumer spending behaviors (e.g. continued\\npractice of social distancing, decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending).\\ndecreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would\\nnegatively impact our financial results. there is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty, as a result of the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise,\\npersist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent\\ndiscretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry.\\n• failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market\\n\\nprice and volatility of our stock.\\n\\nfailure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to net revenues, operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales growth,\\noperating cash flows and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. in addition, price and\\nvolume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance.\\nrisks related to brand relevance and brand execution\\n• our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results.\\nwe believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our\\nglobal social impact programs. the starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. to be\\nsuccessful in the future, particularly outside of the u.s. where the starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow\\nand leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.\\nbusiness incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand\\nvalue, potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. such incidents include\\nactual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food\\nhandlers infected with communicable diseases, such as covid-19, or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. the impact of such incidents\\nmay be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation.\\nconsumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the\\nquality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the\\nsourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at starbucks stores, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other\\npurposes. additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, publicly take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive\\nconsumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent\\nthe brand well or foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\n• if our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our\\n\\nfinancial results could suffer.\\n\\nour global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners,\\nincluding licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global channel development\\nbusiness. licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to\\ncustomers. we believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide\\ntraining and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. however, the product quality and service they deliver\\nmay still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. we do not have direct control over our business partners, including in their adherence to\\nadditional sanitation protocols and guidelines as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, and may not have visibility into their practices.\\nwe also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners and in certain cases such products are\\nproduced or sourced by our licensees directly. and although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their\\nfoodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-starbucks products served in those locations. additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of\\nour intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative\\nimpact on our financial results.\\n• incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse\\n\\npublic or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business.\\n\\ninstances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration,\\ncontamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of\\ncompanies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors. any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales\\nand could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) and/or temporary store closures. clean water is critical to the preparation of\\ncoffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure a clean water and ice supply to our stores can be limited, particularly\\nin some international locations. we are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, which\\nincreases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error.\\nwe also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. we monitor the operations of\\ncertain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be\\ndifficult to detect contamination or other defect in these products. furthermore, due to the covid-19 pandemic, there are stricter health regulations and guidelines\\nand increased public concern over food safety standards and controls. potential food safety incidents, whether at our stores or involving our business partners,\\ncould lead to wide public exposure, which could materially harm our business.\\nadditionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and\\nsafety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers, especially in light of the heightened safety protocols as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. in\\naddition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless\\nof whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely\\naffect our sales on a regional or global basis. a decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary\\nclosure of any of our stores, product recalls, viral-contaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially\\nharm our business and results of operations.\\n• we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business\\n\\nand financial results.\\n\\nthere is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected\\nreturns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. these strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of\\noperations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include:\\n\\n• being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience;\\n• building our leadership position around coffee;\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\n• driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and\\n\\ninternationally;\\n\\n• simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers;\\n• increasing the scale of the starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats, including the\\n\\naccelerated development of alternative store formats (such as starbucks  pickup stores, starbucks now stores and curbside pickup) in light of the\\ncovid-19 pandemic;\\n\\n®\\n\\n• adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors in light of the covid-19 pandemic; \\n• moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-owned model in other markets;\\n• creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup;\\n• continuing the global growth of our channel development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with nestlé and other\\n\\nchannel development business partners;\\n\\n• delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business, including our tea business through the teavana brand in our starbucks  retail stores and other\\n\\n®\\n\\nchannels and internationally; and\\n\\n• reducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses.\\n\\nin addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a\\nmaterial adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following:\\n\\n• imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees;\\n• construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control\\nor a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets\\nin the u.s. and internationally;\\n\\n• governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores due to the covid-19 pandemic;\\n• not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad\\n\\nrange of high-quality food offerings; and\\n\\n• the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our\\n\\ninitiatives.\\n\\neffectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a\\ndegree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. if we are not successful in implementing our\\nstrategic initiatives, such as large acquisitions and integrations, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles,\\nhave become impaired. in the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results.\\n• evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business.\\nour continued success depends on our ability to retain and convert customers. our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending\\naway from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to “brick & mortar” retail\\nstores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands\\n(such as the global expansion of the starbucks brand) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our\\ndelivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. in addition, some of our products\\ncontain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including\\nthe suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. particularly in the u.s., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity,\\nas well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. while we have a variety\\nof beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other\\ncompounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity\\nor litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business\\nand results of operations. furthermore, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the covid-19 pandemic,\\nwhich has resulted in a disruption of customer routines, changes to employer “work-\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\nfrom-home” policies, reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on\\nour products.\\nrisks related to cybersecurity and data privacy\\n• the unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of starbucks proprietary or confidential\\ninformation that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential\\nliability and loss of revenues.\\n\\nmany of our information technology systems (and those of our licensees and other third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary\\nservers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs and\\nadministrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. many of our information\\ntechnology systems also contain starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development\\ninitiatives and designs. similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise\\nour information technology systems. similar to other companies, the number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year but could be exacerbated to\\nsome extent by an increase in our digital operations in our efforts to comply with state and local mandates in response to covid-19. to the extent we or a third\\nparty were to experience a material breach of our or such third parties\\' information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction\\nor other compromises of customers\\' or employees\\' data or confidential information of the company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or\\nother external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain\\nor attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable u.s. and\\ninternational privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings,\\nany of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. for example, the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in\\nmay 2018, called the general data protection regulation (“gdpr”), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data,\\nincluding its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. failure to meet the gdpr\\nrequirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and\\nassociations. additionally, the california privacy act of 2018 (“ccpa”), which was enacted in june 2018 and came into effect on january 1, 2020, provides a new\\nprivate right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their\\ndata collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. our reputation and brand and our ability to\\nattract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s\\ninformation technology systems. such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.\\ncompliance with the gdpr, the ccpa and other current and future applicable international and u.s. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and\\ntime-consuming. significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches,\\nincluding costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. these\\ncosts, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success\\nof future attempts to breach our information technology systems.\\nmedia or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also\\nadversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and\\nbreach information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are\\nlaunched or have been in place for a period of time. we continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and\\nimplement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data\\nloss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.\\n• we rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of\\n\\nthat technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results.\\n\\nwe rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing\\nand payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, starbucks cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile\\npayments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one\\nanother for their functionality. additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\nrelationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. furthermore, due to social distancing\\nmeasures put in place as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, we have accelerated the transformation of our store portfolio by expanding convenience-led formats,\\nwhich depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. we also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems\\nand support. additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across\\nour markets. although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate\\neffectively and be available. such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network\\nfailures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or\\nservices, errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through\\ncyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed\\nin more detail in this risk factors section. if our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner\\nthey could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our\\noperations and our financial results. in addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.\\nrisks related to labor and supply chain\\n•  our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations.\\nthe growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to\\nwhich we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the\\nperformance of our business partners under such agreements. our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that\\nmay limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. our channel development business is heavily reliant on nestlé, which\\nacquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. if nestlé fails to perform its\\ndistribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in channel development, our channel\\ndevelopment business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our channel\\ndevelopment business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. additionally, the growth of our channel development business is\\nin part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses.\\nthere are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. if they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are\\notherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets. our business\\npartners may be materially adversely impacted by the covid-19 pandemic and may not have sufficient financial support and capital to remain financially solvent\\nand may not have the ability to meet their development goals and targets.\\ndue to the covid-19 pandemic, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the disruption to the operations of our business\\npartners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, through the effects of business and facilities\\nclosures, reductions in operating hours, social, economic, political or labor instability in affected areas, transportation delays, travel restrictions and changes in\\noperating procedures, including for additional cleaning and safety protocols.\\n• increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other\\n\\ncommodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\\n\\nthe availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. we purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica\\ncoffee beans and related coffee products. the high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “c”\\nprice. this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. increases in the “c”\\ncoffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. we frequently\\nenter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the\\nbase “c” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established.\\nthe supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather (including the potential effects of\\nclimate change), natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions and the\\nactions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas\\nor by restricting coffee supplies. speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. because of the significance of\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\ncoffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases\\nin the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. in addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient\\nquantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which\\ncould have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\\nwe also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. additionally, and\\nalthough less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs,\\nsuch as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. increases in the cost\\nof dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in\\ninternational markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.\\n• interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability.\\nany material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants,\\ninterruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as\\nincreased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that\\ncause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. additionally, our food, beverage and\\nother products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or\\nsourced by our licensees directly. we rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. our ability to find qualified\\nsuppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food\\nofferings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the u.s. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing\\neconomies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest. for certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. a supplier\\'s failure to\\nmeet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. these issues could have a material\\nnegative impact on our business and profitability.\\n• changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\\nour business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most\\nsignificant costs, both domestically and internationally, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits;\\nincreased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees\\nwith the right skill sets and increased wages, benefits and costs related to the covid-19 pandemic. the growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to\\nlocate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees\\nworldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.\\nfurthermore, due to the covid-19 pandemic, we could experience a shortage of labor for store positions as concern over exposure to covid-19 and other factors\\ncould decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. in addition, our wages and benefits programs, combined with the challenging conditions due\\nto the covid-19 pandemic, may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent.\\n• the loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results.\\nmuch of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. the loss of any of our executive officers or other\\nkey senior management personnel could harm our business. our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees\\non whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain\\nhigh quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. our ability to attract and retain\\nboth corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of\\nqualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. additionally, there is intense\\ncompetition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our\\ndigital relationships with customers. if we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our\\nprojected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\n®\\n\\nrisks related to competition\\n• we face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability.\\nthe specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and\\nmobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets. accordingly, we do not have\\nleadership positions in all channels and markets. in the u.s., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality\\nspecialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to starbucks  stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and\\nresults of operations. similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller\\ncompanies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. many small\\ncompetitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of\\ncustomer traffic to our stores in those markets. increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage\\nmarkets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment. furthermore, declines\\nin general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our\\nproducts, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging\\neconomic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business.\\nrisks related to operating a global business\\n• we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our americas operating segment.\\nour financial performance is highly dependent on our americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately 70% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal\\n2020. if the americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, or does not successfully recover in the post covid-19 environment, especially in our\\nu.s. market, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. and because\\nthe americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash\\nflows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders.\\n• we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets.\\nour future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. some or all of our international market business\\nunits (“mbus”), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth,\\nwhich ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. the performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by\\neconomic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large mbus operate. a decline in performance of one or more of our significant international\\nmbus could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results.\\nthe international segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our americas segment. in particular, our china mbu contributes\\nmeaningfully to both consolidated and international net revenues and operating income. china is currently our fastest growing market, our second largest market\\noverall and 100% company-owned. due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in china, including the risks\\nmentioned elsewhere and the following:\\n\\n• the effects of current u.s.-china relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts\\n\\nand increasing anti-americanism;\\n\\n• escalating u.s.-china tension and increasing political sensitivities in china;\\n• the effects of the covid-19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in china;\\n• entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in china;\\n• changes in economic conditions in china and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation discretionary spending\\n\\nand real estate and supply chain costs;\\n\\n• ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to public health, food safety, tariffs and tax, sustainability, bringing uncertainty and\\n\\ninconsistent interpretations, which may be contrary to ours, as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs; and\\n• food-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\nadditionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our u.s. stores and licensees.\\ntastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some mbus may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the u.s. or other international\\nmarkets. occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the u.s. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of\\ncompliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses\\nas a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations.\\n• we face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance.\\nwe operate in over 80 markets globally. our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as:\\n\\n• foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies;\\n• changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on u.s. businesses due to\\n\\nincreasing anti-american sentiment in certain markets;\\n\\n• interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations;\\n• uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the united kingdom\\'s referendum to withdraw membership from the european union (referred to as\\n\\n“brexit”), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications;\\n\\n• restrictive actions of foreign or u.s. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension\\nbetween the u.s. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government\\nintervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership;\\n\\n• import or other business licensing requirements;\\n• the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\\n• limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new u.s. and international regulations;\\n• in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we\\n\\nforecast;\\n\\n• difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and\\nservice, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and\\nretaining high quality employees in local markets;\\n\\n• local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees;\\n• local regulations, health guidelines and safety protocols related to the covid-19 pandemic affecting our store operations; and\\n• delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available\\nfor lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating\\nincome and earnings per share.\\n\\nmoreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects.\\nrisks related to governmental and regulatory changes\\n• failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results.\\nour policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and\\nrequirements, including those imposed by the sec, nasdaq and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation,\\nsafety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or\\nadditional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on\\ncommercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our\\nbusiness partners, which could affect our profitability. furthermore, due to the covid-19\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0ctable of contents\\n\\npandemic, we are subject to additional domestic and foreign governmental regulations and health guidelines, as well as any other voluntary safety protocols.\\nin addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving u.s. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and\\ncompanies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting\\nfederal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. the interpretation and application\\nof existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional\\nlegislative and regulatory proposals in this area. current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the gdpr and the ccpa,\\ndiscussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and u.s. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and\\nregulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of\\nfines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the burdens imposed by these and other laws and\\nregulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching\\ncompliance in a manner adverse to our business.\\nin addition, the european commission in july 2016 and the swiss government in january 2017 approved the eu-u.s. and the swiss-u.s. privacy shield\\nframeworks, respectively, which are designed to allow u.s. companies that self-certify to the u.s. department of commerce and publicly commit to comply with\\nthe privacy shield requirements to freely import personal data from the eu and switzerland. however, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and\\ntheir validity remains subject to legal, regulatory and political developments in both europe and the u.s. the eu-u.s. privacy shield framework approved by the\\neuropean commission, which is relied upon for transfers of personal data outside the european economic area could be invalidated by the court of justice of the\\neuropean union. the potential invalidation of this mechanism could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside\\nof the european economic area.\\nthe complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and\\nregulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. in\\naddition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well\\nas changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and\\npenalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial
